# Keywords

---

Adding keywords to your metadata record allows for the record to be found later in a search, keywords are the way to tag your projects or products. The mdEditor is designed using thesauruses that contain pre-determined keywords. These thesauruses thus create a 'controlled vocabulary' so that all LCC staff adding metadata can adhere to the same standards, and future search results can return back clear results of projects and products.
