# Record Metadata

---

Record Metadata allows you to describe your record's metadata, including a description of the process of metadata creation, contributors to the creation of the metadata, and metadata repositories.

---

* **Metadata Contacts: **are required and selected from your list of contacts. Adding a metadata contact will give LCC staff a contact point should they have any questions about the metadata._ Consult the _[_**Contacts**_](/contacts.md)_** **section of this manual to learn how to add contacts._

* The **Metadata** **Identifier **is automatically created by mdEditor. The metadata identifier gives each of your projects and products a unique ID and differentiates them from other similar projects and products.

* The **Parent Metadata **is used to define the folder on ScienceBase where the project or product will be published to. Adding parent metadata lets mdEditor know where the data should go when it is published to ScienceBase. It also lets LCC staff search for other items that may be in the same location in ScienceBase. _Consult the _[_**Parent Metadata**_](/record/edit/metadata/parent-metadata.md)_** **section of this manual to learn how to create parent metadata._

* **Metadata Repositories **indicate where the metadata should be sent. Select the LCCScienceCatalog as your repository. Selecting LCCScienceCatalog insures that your item will appear in the National LCC Science Catalog.

  * For **Projects **that should be listed in the LCC Science Catalog: Enter_ “LCCScienceCatalog” from the picklist as repository and “LCC Network Science Catalog_” as collection title \(these should be entered in your Settings as default repositories. **Note:** this is a free-text field, so the title must be exactly the same in order to insure that the metadata is harvested for the LCC Science Catalog.\)

  * For **Data Products** that should be shared with Data.gov, Enter “data.gov” and “data.gov” from the picklist as repository and enter “data.gov” followed by your LCC name as the collection title. **Note**: this is a free-text field, so the repository title must be exactly the same for every metadata record to insure proper harvesting of metadata
