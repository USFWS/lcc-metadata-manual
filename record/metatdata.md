# Record Metadata

---

Record Metadata is the place to enter key metadata into your record.

* **Metadata Contacts: **are required and selected from your list of contacts. Adding a metadata contact will give LCC staff a contact point should they have any questions about the metadata.

  * Consult the [**Contacts**](/contacts.md)** **section of this manual to learn how to add contacts.

* The **Metadata** **Identifier **is automatically created by mdEditor. The metadata identifier gives each of your projects and products a unique id and differentiates them from other similar projects and products.

* The **Parent Metadata **is used to define the folder on ScienceBase where the project or product will be published to. Adding parent metadata lets mdEditor know where the data should go when it is published to ScienceBase. It also lets LCC staff search for other items that may be in the same location in ScienceBase.

  * Consult the [**Parent Metadata**](/record/edit/metadata/parent-metadata.md)** **section of this manual to learn how to create parent metadata.



* **Metadata Repositories **indicate where the metadata should be sent. Select the LCCScienceCatalog as your repository. Selecting LCCScienceCatalog insures that your item will appear in the National LCC Science Catalog.
