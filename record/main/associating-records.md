## Project Entry Guidance: Record Associated

---

The **Associated** section is used to connect items with each other. This feature should be used when items are related \(products are often the result of projects, and projects often have sub-projects\). All of these can be linked together by means of association. Adding associations will give LCC staff the ability to find items that relate to each other in ScienceBase.

## Create Associations

There are two ways to create associations. You can either associate a product with a project **or **associate a project with a product. If your records were imported from ScienceBase, the record associations may be automatically created, but sometimes you may have to create the associations manually \(as described below\).
