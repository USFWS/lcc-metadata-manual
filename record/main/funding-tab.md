## **Allocation**

**Allocation**: Describes how the funds were allocated. Adding allocation allows LCC staff to see where funding came from and how it was distributed. It also lets staff find your items when searching for specific funders.

* **REQUIRED**: Add the relevant contact for “source” of the project funding. Should be an organization, not an individual. For LCC projects, the most common sources are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation.

* **REQUIRED: **Add the relevant contact for “recipient” of the project funding. Should be an organization, not an individual.

> Note: Award ID is required if it is available. These may include grant or cooperative agreement numbers, contract numbers, or interagency agreement numbers.

## Time Period

**Time Period**: For each allocation, enter the fiscal year that funds were awarded \(not the time span of the entire project\). There should be a single fiscal year for each allocation. Adding a time period lets users know when your items were funded, and lets them find your item when searching for items funded in a similar time period.

> **NOTE: **If you put in a start and end date, mdEditor will calculate fiscal year based on the end date. Fiscal Year can be selected independently from start and end date.
