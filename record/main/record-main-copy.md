### POINT OF CONTACT\(S\)

Adding a point of contact gives LCC staff information on who to contact should they have a question regarding your project or product. From the **Role **drop-down menu, select **pointOfContact**. From the **Contacts **drop-down menu, select a contact from the list of contacts. _To add contacts, you have to have created contacts prior to making a metadata record. See the _[_Contact _](/product-entry-guidance/contact-entry-guidance.md)_Section for information on how to create contacts._

* **REQUIRED: **Enter **the LCC Network Data Steward **as a "pointOfContact."

> The LCC Network Data Steward will serve as the long term contact/backup. This way, users have a point-of-contact even if there is a positional change within an organization. The LCC Network Data Steward should be included in addition to any point of contact that you want to add from your organization

* **REQUIRED:** Enter your LCC as "pointOfContact."

* **BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE**: Enter the Project PI as "principalInvestigator."

### CITATION

**The citation **lets LCC staff know pertinent information about your project or product such as: responsible parties; internal and ScienceBase identifier; and any online resources that may relate to your item. Adding information in the citation will also allow LCC staff to find your item when they search for items that contain said information.
