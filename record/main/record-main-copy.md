## Point of Contacts

Adding a point of contact gives users information on who to contact should they have a question regarding your project or product. 

{% hint style='info' %} To add contacts to a metadata record, you must first create/upload the contacts into mdEditor. See the _[_Contact _](/product-entry-guidance/contact-entry-guidance.md)_Section for more information. {% endhint %}

### ** Contacts - Required: **

| Role | Contact |
| :--- | :--- |
| pointOfContact | LCC Network Data Steward |
| pointOfContact | Your LCC  |

{% hint style='info' %} The LCC Network Data Steward will serve as the long term contact/backup. This way, users have a point-of-contact even if there is a positional change within an organization. The LCC Network Data Steward should be included in addition to any point of contact that you want to add from your organization. {% endhint %}

### Contacts - Best Practices:

## Citation

**The Citation **describes pertinent information about your project such as: responsible parties, internal and ScienceBase identifiers, and any online resources that may relate to your item. Adding information in the citation will also improve users' abilities to find your items.

### Citation Required Fields

#### **Title **\(Required\)

The citation title is automatically populated with the title of your record.

#### **Alternate Title **\(Optional\)

Add an alternate title.

#### **Dates **\(Optional\)

Enter _acquisition, creation, revision,_ or another date reference from the picklist and then enter the date.

#### **Responsible Parties **\(Required\)

Responsible parties must include a point of contact, but may also include other responsible parties such as funders \(including your LCC\), partners, collaborators, and contributors. Collaborators could be intellectual participants while contributors could be intellectual and financial participants.

{% hint style='info' %} To add contacts to a metadata record, you must first create/upload the contacts in mdEditor. See the [Contacts ](/contacts.md)section for more information.{% endhint %}

##### Responsible Parties - Required:

| Role | Contact |

#### **Online Resource** \(Required, if available\)

Enter the Name and URL for the project homepage on your LCC website.

{% hint style='tip' %} **Best Practice**: Use the identifier that your LCC is already using, or create something unique that is easily identifiable. {% endhint %}



{% hint style='info' %}If you know your item's ScienceBase ID, you may add it here. If your item does not have a ScienceBase ID, ScienceBase will create one automatically upon publishing. If you edit an item that is already on ScienceBase without using its existing ID, a duplicate item will be created. Consult the [Publish](/publish.md) section of this manual to learn more.{% endhint %}

The following identifiers are optional but you may add them:

* Digital Object Identifier \(DOI\)
* Archive Folder Name

## **Time Period**

**Time Period** refers to project start and end date.

{% hint style='tip' %} This set of dates is distinct from the fiscal year of funding. Here you want to indicate the overall project start and end dates. In the Funding section you will specify the fiscal years that funds were allocated.{% endhint %}

### Dates \(Required\)

For each project, add a Start Date and End Date. If the project spanned a single fiscal year, you can select the relevant year from the Fiscal Year dropdown. Selecting a Fiscal Year will automatically update the Start and End Dates.
