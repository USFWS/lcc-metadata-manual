## Opening mdEditor

mdEditor is currently hosted on the GitHub website and can be opened by following this URL: [**https://www.mdeditor.org/**](https://www.mdeditor.org/)

Currently, when you open mdEditor, you will see an _Update Alert_ that the application is in beta testing. This is normal and will remain as such until the production version is ready.

## Suggested Workflow for Using mdEditor

1. **Gather information needed for your metadata entries.**
   * Have information about your contacts, projects, and products on hand before you begin creating metadata records. 
2. **Set the correct default **[**Settings**](/settings.md)** **
   * In mdEditor settings, you will need to set the LCC specific settings for the Metadata Repositories and the Publishing Settings.
3. **Create or import **[**Contacts**](/contacts.md)**.**
   * Contacts must be created or uploaded before they can be used in metadata records. 
4. **Create or import **[**Projects**](/project-entry-guidance.md)**.**
5. **Create or import **[**Products**](/product-entry-guidance.md)**.**
6. **Create desired Associations between Projects and/or Products**
   * Associations can be either [associated from a project ](/record/main/associating-records.md)or [associated from a product.](/product-entry-guidance/associating-records-products.md)
7. [**Publish **](/publish.md)**your records to ScienceBase.**
8. [**Export**](/data-management.md)** your records and contacts for backup, transfer, or sharing.**
   * You may want to export working backups before publishing depending on your situation, but archival exports should be done after publishing since publishing can alter records, like adding or changing a ScienceBase ID.
