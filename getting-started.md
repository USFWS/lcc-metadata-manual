## Suggested Workflow for LCC Metadata and mdEditor

The following is a suggested workflow for using mdEditor to create, publish, and save metadata records for LCC projects and products.

### **Step 1: Gather information needed for your metadata entries.**

Have information about your contacts, projects, and products on hand before you begin creating metadata records. Key information to gather includes project proposals, funding agreements and amounts, project reports, product information, and contact information for individuals and organizations involved in the projects.

Use the "contacts seed file" that contains pre-filled information and standard naming conventions for all LCCs, common federal agencies, and the LCC Network Data Steward.

### Step 2: Open mdEditor.

The direct link to mdEditor is [https://go.mdeditor.org](https://go.mdeditor.org). Choose the browser you plan to use for mdEditor and bookmark this link.

mdEditor can also be accessed from its homepage at [https://www.mdeditor.org/](https://www.mdeditor.org/). This site provides some background information and Frequently Asked Questions about mdEditor.

### **Step 3: Set the correct default **[**Settings**](/settings.md).** **

In mdEditor settings, set the LCC-specific settings for Importing, Metadata Repositories, and Publishing.

### **Step 4: Create or import **[**Contacts**](/contacts.md)**.**

Contacts must be created or uploaded before they can be added to project and product metadata records.

### **Step 5: Create or import **[**Projects**](/project-entry-guidance.md)**.**

If you have an existing ScienceBase project record that has not been edited in mdEditor, import the ScienceBase record to create a new mdEditor record.

If you have no existing metadata for a project, create an mdEditor project record from scratch.

If you have already created an mdEditor record for the project, import the mdEditor file to continue editing.

### **Step 6: Create or import **[**Products**](/product-entry-guidance.md)**.**

If you have an existing ScienceBase product record that has not been edited in mdEditor, import the ScienceBase record to create a new mdEditor record.

If you have no existing metadata for a product, create an mdEditor product record from scratch.

If you have already created an mdEditor record for the product, import the mdEditor file to continue editing.

### Step 7: For applicable Products, create or import Data Dictionaries.

### **Step 8: Complete metadata.**

Decide on your desired file management approach and complete your metadata accordingly. See the [File Management](https://cookmt.gitbooks.io/mdeditor-for-lccs/content/data-management/file-management.html "File Management") section for options and instructions.

### Step 9: **Create desired Associations between Projects and/or Products.**

Associations can be either [associated from a project ](/record/main/associating-records.md)or [associated from a product.](/product-entry-guidance/associating-records-products.md)

### **Step 10: **[**Publish **](/publish.md)**your records to ScienceBase.**

### **Step 11: **[**Export**](/data-management.md)** your records and contacts for backup, transfer, or sharing.**

You may want to export working backups before publishing depending on your situation, but archival exports should be done after publishing since publishing can alter records, like adding or changing a ScienceBase ID.

### Step 12: Review the resulting entries in the [LCC Science Catalog](https://lccnetwork.org/catalog).

The Science Catalog updates overnight so you should review newly-published records the day after you publish to ScienceBase. This will be one of your best quality control

## Understanding Projects, Products, and Contacts

Contacts, projects, and products all share a relationship in mdEditor and are each entered independently.

### Projects

The target projects for the Science Catalog are science projects whose topic and resulting products have value to partners or the public being able to discover and access them. Many projects are the result of financial assistance agreements, contracts, or interagency agreements. However, not everything funded through one of these mechanisms needs to be in the Science Catalog.

> tip: Individual data managers may want to track other projects using the same metadata format and store that information on ScienceBase, without publishing that information to the Science Catalog.

### Products

Products are the specific tools, resources, and data generated. These will usually be the direct result of a project though there may be some products without a parent project.

### **Contacts**

Contacts are the creators, curators, contributors, and funders of projects and products. Contacts can be individuals or organizations. Individuals can also be members of organizations. Contacts can be entered once in mdEditor and then added to multiple projects and products.

> tip or info: Consult the [Contacts](/contacts.md) section for information on adding contacts.

### Relationships

**Projects and Products **will always have a relationship with a contact. Projects will always have at least one point of contact \(the LCC Network Data Steward\). Additional contact relationships may include project authors, metadata creators, funders, principal investigators, publishers, distributors, and many others. One crucial contact relationship between contacts, projects, and products is the role of the individual\(s\) and/or organization\(s\) who provided funding. This may include a direct full contributor or any partners that helped with funding.

> tip: Contact types are specified in the contact record \(examples: federal, state, NGO\). Specific roles for each contact are defined within the respective project and product records \(examples: principal investigator, collaborator\).

**Products are often the results of projects**. mdEditor defines the relationships between projects and products through the Associated feature.

> tip or info: Consult either the [Associating Records: Product](/product-entry-guidance/associating-records-products.md) or [Associating Records: Project](/record/main/associating-records.md) section for more information\).
