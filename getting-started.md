## Getting Started

---

### Opening mdEditor

* mdEditor is currently hosted on the GitHub website and can be opened by following this URL: [**https://www.mdeditor.org/**](https://www.mdeditor.org/)

* _Chrome_ is the recommended web browser for using mdEditor. The editor will work in other browsers, but has been fully tested in Chrome.

> ![](/assets/note_small.png)Currently, when you open mdEditor, you will see an _Update Alert_ that the application is in beta testing. This is normal and will remain as such until the production version is ready.

### Preparing to Add Items

You will need to prepare some information and settings before adding your metadata records.

* Make sure you have all metadata information on hand before you begin the process of adding items \(consult the [**Quick Reference** ](/quick-reference.md)or** **[**Fields Required for Projects and Products **](/record/fields-required-for-lcc-projects-and-products.md)section of this manual to learn what metadata you will need\). 
* Make sure to add Contacts into mdEditor. Projects and products require one or more contacts. Personal and organization contacts require a name and email address at a minimum \(consult the [**Contacts**](/contacts.md) section of this manual to learn how to add contacts\). 
* Some \(but not all\) projects and products will need to be associated with each other. Keep a list of items that will require associations. \(The [**Association**](/record/record-associated.md) section of this manual describes the process of making associations, but does not need to be consulted until the project that will be used in the association has been created.\)
