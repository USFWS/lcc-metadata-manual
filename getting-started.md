## Opening mdEditor

mdEditor is currently hosted on the GitHub website and can be opened by following this URL: [**https://www.mdeditor.org/**](https://www.mdeditor.org/)

Currently, when you open mdEditor, you will see an _Update Alert_ that the application is in beta testing. This is normal and will remain as such until the production version is ready.

## Suggested Workflow for Using mdEditor

The following is a basic suggested workflow for using mdEditor to create, publish, and save metadata records.

### **Step 1. Gather information needed for your metadata entries.**

Have information about your contacts, projects, and products on hand before you begin creating metadata records. Key information to gather includes project proposals, funding agreements and amounts, project reports, product information, and contact information for individuals and organizations involved in the projects.

### **Step 2. Set the correct default **[**Settings**](/settings.md).** **

In mdEditor settings, set the LCC-specific settings for Importing, Metadata Repositories, and Publishing.

### **Step 3. Create or import **[**Contacts**](/contacts.md)**.**

Contacts must be created or uploaded before they can be added to project and product metadata records.

### **Step 4. Create or import **[**Projects**](/project-entry-guidance.md)**.**

If you have an existing ScienceBase project record that has not been edited in mdEditor, import the ScienceBase record to create a new mdEditor record.

If you have no existing metadata, create an mdEditor project record from scratch.

If you have already created an mdEditor record for the project, import the mdEditor file to continue editing.

### **Step 5. Create or import **[**Products**](/product-entry-guidance.md)**.**

If you have an existing ScienceBase product record that has not been edited in mdEditor, import the ScienceBase record to create a new mdEditor record.

If you have no existing metadata, create an mdEditor product record from scratch.

If you have already created an mdEditor record for the product, import the mdEditor file to continue editing.

### **Step 6. Create desired Associations between Projects and/or Products**

Associations can be either [associated from a project ](/record/main/associating-records.md)or [associated from a product.](/product-entry-guidance/associating-records-products.md)

### **Step 7. **[**Publish **](/publish.md)**your records to ScienceBase.**

### **Step 8. **[**Export**](/data-management.md)** your records and contacts for backup, transfer, or sharing.**

You may want to export working backups before publishing depending on your situation, but archival exports should be done after publishing since publishing can alter records, like adding or changing a ScienceBase ID.
