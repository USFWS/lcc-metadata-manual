# Metadata

The **Metadata **tab has two requirements: **Metadata Contacts **and **Parent Metadata.    
**

* The **Metadata Contacts **includes any individual or organization from your **Contact **list that may be associated with the creation of the metadata. These may include an **Author**, a **pointOfContact**, or any other contact that you see fit.

* The **Parent Metadata **is a particularly important type of citation. It denotes the LCC's project folder on the ScienceBase website. To edit the **Parent Metadata **citation do the following:  
  
  Click the ** Edit Citation  **button.  
  
  Enter a **Title** of the LCC project folder.  
  
  Click the **Add **button next to **Identifier**.  
  
  In the **Identifier **field, add the ScienceBase ID. This will be a string of numbers and letters in the URL of your project folder that looks something like the following: 59b97600e4b091459a54d9f3.  
  
  From the **Namespace **dropdown, select **ScienceBase**.  
  
  Click **Back to Parent Metadata**.**  
  
  **Click **Back to Metadata**.  
  
  Click **Save**.
