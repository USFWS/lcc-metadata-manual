# Projects

## Overview

MDEditor allows for the creation of projects from scratch or from an existing template. Project information can be added manually or imported from an existing MDEditor record.

After [Creating a Project](/projects/creating-an-project-record.md), metadata is added manually using the following tabs:

[Main](/projects/main.md)

[Metadata](/projects/metadata.md)

[Keywords](/projects/keywords.md)

[Extent](/projects/extent.md)

[Funding](/projects/funding.md)
