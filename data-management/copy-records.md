# Copying Records

The **Copy** button is located in right vertical menu. It makes a duplicate of metadata record. Consult the [**Getting Started**](/getting-started.md) section of this manual for more information on the **Vertical Menu**.

Use the Copy button carefully:

* Making a copy will generate a new ID for the copied record and be named “Copy of …”. All the other info will remain the same including associations. The “metadata identifier” is NOT copied but any identifiers in the main citation WILL be copied.

* Make sure you review all of the copied information before saving.

* You can use the copy functionality to start a new product metadata record.

* You can use copy to populate multiple products \(e.g., multiple workshop reports, poster based on a publication, etc.\).

* You can create a template record for your LCC or for a project that can be used as a starting place for each full metadata record.
