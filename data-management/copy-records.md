## Copying Records

---

The **Copy** button is located in the mdEditor action menu on the right-hand side of the screen. The Copy Button makes a duplicate of a metadata record. Making a copy of a record can be used to: start a new product metadata record, populate multiple products faster \(e.g., multiple workshop reports, a poster based on a publication\), or create a 'template record' for a project that can be used as a starting place for each full metadata record

### General Notes On Copying Records

### ![](/assets/copy_button.png)

![](/assets/caution.png)**Use the Copy button carefully:**

_Making a copy will generate a new ID for the copied record and be named “Copy of …”. All the other info will remain the same including associations. The “metadata identifier” is NOT copied but any identifiers in the main citation WILL be copied._

**Making a copy of a record can be used to:**

* Start a new product metadata record
* Populate multiple products faster \(e.g., multiple workshop reports, a poster based on a publication\)
* Create a 'template record' for a project that can be used as a starting place for each full metadata record

> **NOTE:** Before saving, carefully review all information in copied record to ensure all copied info is still relevant to the copied record, particularly any identifiers.
