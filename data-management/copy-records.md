## Copying Records

---

The **Copy** button is located in the action menu. It makes a duplicate of a metadata record. Consult the[ **Record Show**](/record-show.md) section of this manual for more information on using the Action Menu. Making a copy of a record can be used to:** s**tart a new product metadata record, populate multiple products faster \(e.g., multiple workshop reports, a poster based on a publication\), or create a 'template record' for a project that can be used as a starting place for each full metadata record

### General Notes On Copying Records

### ![](/assets/copy_button.png)

> ![](/assets/note_small.png) Use the Copy button carefully:

_Making a copy will generate a new ID for the copied record and be named “Copy of …”. All the other info will remain the same including associations. The “metadata identifier” is NOT copied but any identifiers in the main citation WILL be copied._

**Making a copy of a record can be used to:**

* Start a new product metadata record
* Populate multiple products faster \(e.g., multiple workshop reports, a poster based on a publication\)
* Create a 'template record' for a project that can be used as a starting place for each full metadata record

> ![](/assets/note_small.png)**Note**: Before saving, carefully review all info in copied record to ensure all copied info is still relevant to the copied record, particularly any identifiers.
