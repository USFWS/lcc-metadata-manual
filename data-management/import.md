* **Click to Import Data**
  * Imports selected records and contacts.
* **Cancel Import**
  * Cancels the current import.
* **Replace/Merge**
  * Replaces or merges the current record.
    * To import Settings, you should set the import to “Replace.” Generally, it is best practice to set the mode back to “Merge,” once you’ve finished importing the settings.
