## File Management

---

mdEditor.json files can be exported and imported via mdEditor's built-in [**Export** ](/data-management/export.md)and [**Import**](/data-management/import.md)** **functionality. The Export functionality allows you to back up and share your records between browsers. The Import functionality lets you load the most recent records, and load records that were exported from another browser or downloaded from ScienceBase or another database.

### mdEditor File Management Strategies:

#### **Work on project-by-project basis.**

In order to keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on, and then export one project \(and its related products and contacts\) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that your organization uses to organize data.

* _Save each project and affiliated products together** as a set**_**.** To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, then select the appropriate records \(i.e., the target project and its affiliated products\) and then click “Export Selected".

* Save the resulting mdEditor JSON file to your hard drive in a working folder. There should be a separate mdEditor JSON file for each project and all of its products.

#### **Leave Information in mdEditor in-between work sessions**

It is recommended that you leave your contacts in mdEditor between work sessions so that they will be available the next time you need to create metadata records. You can also export your contacts independently of your records for use between browsers.

You can also set up a metadata directory so you can always find the metadata file. This directory can be any folder on your local computer that is easily accessible and will not be deleted.

#### **Export your contacts with your records**

When exporting products or projects,  you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not in your library, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact to that record.

#### Export frequently to backup your records

Maintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor \(or switch browsers, URLs, etc.\). This is the only way to backup your records.  For more information, consult [Export](/data-management/export.md).

It is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor's **Clear Storage Cache **functionality \(clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered into the mdEditor\). Exporting insures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn more.
