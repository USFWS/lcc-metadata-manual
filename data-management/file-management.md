# File Management

---

mdEditor.json files can be exported and imported via mdEditor's built in **Export** and **Import **functionality \(described in the [Export](/export.md) and [Import](/import.md) section of this manual\). The Export functionality allows you to back up and share your records between browsers. The Import functionality lets you load the most recent records and load records that were exported from another browser.

## File Management Notes and Best Practices

### General Workflow:

* **Best practice: Work on project-by-project basis.**

  * In order to keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on, and then export one project \(and its related products and contacts\) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that your organization uses to organize data.
  * _Save each project and affiliated products together** as a set**_**.** To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, then select the appropriate records \(i.e., the target project and its affiliated products\) and then click “Export Selected.” Consult the [**Export**](/export.md)** **section of this manual to learn more about export functionality.
  * Save the resulting mdEditor JSON file to your hard drive in a working folder. There should be a separate mdEditor JSON file for each project and all of its products. 
  * When exporting projects and products, export all of your contacts. 

* **Best Practice**: Leave your dictionaries in mdEditor all the time so they’re always available.

* **Best Practice**: Leave your contacts in mdEditor all the time so they’re always available.

* **Best Practice**: Set up a metadata directory so you can always find the metadata file.

* **Best Practice:** Maintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor \(or switch browsers, URLs, etc.\).

### Exporting:

* **Note: **The only way to backup your records is by using the [Export](/export.md) functionality.

* **Best Practice**: When exporting projects and products, export all of your contacts.

* **Best Practice**: It is recommended that you use the [Export](/export.md) functionality frequently to a local computer folder of your choosing. It is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor's **Clear Storage Cache **functionality \(clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered into the mdEditor\). Exporting insures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn more.

### mdEditor Contacts:

### ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)

* **Best Practice**: Export all contacts together \(unless you’re comfortable knowing exactly which contacts are used in your record set\), otherwise if you load a project and the contacts aren’t loaded in mdEditor, you can’t re-add the contacts back into the metadata record.
* **Best Practice**: Save mdEditor contacts at the end of every work session, load before each work session and ensure they are up to date. Then load the project/product record you want to work on.
* **Best Practice**: Leave your contacts in mdEditor all the time so they’re always available. This allows you to readily add contacts to projects and products.
