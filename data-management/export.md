The export function will allow the contents of the current metadata recordset to be saved as a mdEditor or a mdJSON file. The files can then be shared with collaborators and imported into another record set, imported into another browser using mdEditor, or saved to a local workstation as a backup or archival copy. Files are automatically named as “mdeditor-timestamp.json”.

> **Note:**mdJSON files can be uploaded and translated to other formats via the mdTranslator application while mdEditor files are exclusive to the mdEditor application and retain all mdEditor information, including settings.

> **Best Practice**: For a complete backup, use the**Export All**button. This exports an [mdEditor](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdeditor) file containing all records and contacts.
>
> **Best Practice: **Click **Export All **each time you finish a work session in[mdEditor](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdeditor)\(or switch browsers, URLs, etc.\).

### Export Action Menu {#export-action-menu}

While exporting data, there are four options available in the Action Menu \(on the right side of the export data window\).

* **Export All:**will export everything currently loaded in[mdEditor](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdeditor)into a single file. Exports an [mdEditor](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdeditor)[JSON](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#json) file.

* **Export Selected: **will only export the items you have selected \(so individual records, contacts, etc.\). If nothing is selected it will be disabled \(i.e., grayed out\). Exports an [mdEditor](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdeditor)[JSON](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#json) file.

* **Export **[**mdJSON**](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdjson)**: **only works for [metadata](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#metadata)r ecords \(i.e., doesn't work for contacts\). Exports just the [mdJSON](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdjson) file, which is a standalone [JSON](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#json) file you can load into [mdTranslator](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdtranslator) and have translated into other [metadata](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#metadata) formats. [mdJSON](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdjson) files imported into [mdEditor](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdeditor) are treated as new records and will not merge/update an existing record.

* Clicking the **Include Settings **switch will also export [mdEditor](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdeditor) settings. Consult the [Settings](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/settings.html) section of this manual to learn about settings.

> ![](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/assets/note_small.png)If you need to switch browsers for [mdEditor](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdeditor), or want to send your settings to someone else, you can export them.

#### General Notes on Exporting

> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice: **When Exporting Contacts, it is recommended that you export all contacts together. When you import a project, if the contacts list isn't complete, the record may show an error and you will be unable to re-add the contact to the record.
