The export function will allow the contents of the current metadata recordset to be saved as an mdEditor or an mdJSON file. The files can then be shared with collaborators and imported into another record set, imported into another browser using mdEditor, or saved to a local workstation as a backup or archival copy. Files are automatically named as “mdeditor-timestamp.json”.

### **Using Export to Backup Records**

Exporting records is the only way to save records in mdEditor. Maintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor or switch browsers.

**BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES**

* For a complete backup, use the **Export All **button. This exports an [mdEditor](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdeditor) file containing all records and contacts.

* ** **When exporting products or projects,  you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not in your library, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact to that record.

* It is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor's **Clear Storage Cache **functionality \(clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered into the mdEditor\). Exporting insures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn more.

**GENERAL NOTES:**

* mdJSON files can be uploaded and translated to other formats via the mdTranslator application while mdEditor files are exclusive to the mdEditor application and retain all mdEditor information, including settings.

### Export Action Menu {#export-action-menu}

While exporting data, there are four options available in the Action Menu \(on the right side of the export data window\).

* **Export All**: will export everything currently loaded in mdEditor into a single file. Exports an mdEditor JSON file.

* **Export Selected**: will only export the items you have selected \(so individual records, contacts, etc.\). If nothing is selected it will be disabled \(i.e., grayed out\). This exports an mdEditor JSON file.

* **Export mdJSON**: only works for metadata records \(i.e., doesn't work for contacts\). Exports just the mdJSON file, which is a standalone JSON file you can load into mdTranslator and have translated into other metadata formats. mdJSON files imported into mdEditor are treated as new records and will not merge/update an existing record.

* Clicking the **Include Settings** switch will also export mdEditor settings. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn about settings.

> **NOTE: **If you need to switch browsers for [mdEditor](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#mdeditor), or want to send your settings to someone else, you can export the settings. Someone else can then re-import your settings which include the default Metadata Repositories and Publishing Settings.  This will give users that you share with information on your items' folder location on ScienceBase and let users know what your default repository is. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn about settings.
