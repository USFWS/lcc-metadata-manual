# Product Entry Guidance: Dictionaries Tab

---

The **Dictionaries** tab links the product metadata record to a data dictionary that you define. Data dictionaries define attributes of data that are tabular in nature.

There are no LCC-specific requirements or best practices for dictionaries.

---

{% hint style='info' %} If you are going to add a data Dictionary, you will need to switch to the "full" profile to see that tab (the lccProduct profile has not been updated to include that yet).{% endhint %}
