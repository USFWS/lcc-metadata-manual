# Product Entry Guidance: Keywords Tab

---

Adding keywords to your metadata record allows for the record to be found later through a search engine, keywords are the way to tag your projects or products. The mdEditor is designed using thesauruses that contain pre-determined keywords. These thesauruses create a 'controlled vocabulary' so that all LCC staff adding metadata can adhere to the same standards, and future search results can return clear results of projects and products.

### **To add Keywords to your Metadata Record**

1. Click “+ Add Thesaurus” on the right to add the different thesauruses.
2. Add keywords from the following pre-populated thesauruses.
3. If none of the keywords in the following categories are sufficient for tagging your record, you can create a custom thesaurus \(see below for more information\).

| Thesauruses for LCC Staff | Recommendations |
| :--- | :--- |
| ISO Topic Category \(Recommended\) | ISO \(International Organization for Standardization\) topics were built and maintained by the ISO Technical Committee and are required for the development of ISO metadata. Adding ISO Topic Keywords lets your products and projects meet an international standard for controlled vocabulary. |
| LCC Deliverable Types \(Recommended\)  | LCC \(Landscape Conservation Cooperatives\) Keywords are maintained by the national LCCs and required for any LCC projects. Adding LCC keywords lets your products and projects meet a standard that was defined by the national LCCs. |
| LCC End User Types \(Recommended\) | LCC \(Landscape Conservation Cooperatives\) Keywords are maintained by the national LCCs and required for any LCC projects. Adding LCC keywords lets your products and projects meet a standard that was defined by the national LCCs. |

### **Custom Thesaurus **

It is recommended that you use a custom thesaurus only for keywords that are not available in a pre-populated lists. For example, If a certain end user type is not available in the LCC End User Types thesaurus, you can add the type using the Custom thesaurus. However, you can add a Custom thesaurus for any terms that you see fit.

### **General Notes And Best Practices for Keywords**

**NOTES: **Keywords edited in mdEditor will overwrite keywords in ScienceBase.

**BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: **Look for useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. GCMD Science keywords would be the only ones applicable to LCCs. There are GCMD Platforms and Instruments but they are  unlikely to apply to LCCs.
