# data.gov Guidance

---

The information below is based on the best available information about data.gov as of April 2018. A future Department of the Interior data governance board may issue written guidance about what is appropriate for data.gov.

## **What products go into data.gov?**

* Machine-readable, non-proprietary data sets are top priority \(e.g., .csv, txt, etc.\), including GIS files \(e.g., .shp, .jpg, .tif, etc.\).

* If no machine-readable version of the data exists, then proprietary data formats \(e.g., .mdb, .accdb, .xlxs, FGDB, etc.\) may be cataloged.

* Cataloging spatial or non-spatial data web services \(OGC, WMS, WFS, etc.\), ESRI \(map services, feature services, hosted feature layers, image services\), etc. is acceptable.

* Data \(or static maps\) in the form of a .pdf file is acceptable to catalog if there is no other file format of of the data.

* Data.gov is intended for data only. As such, NO publication documents, web pages, or presentation recordings are to be cataloged.

{% hint style='danger' %} Avoid submitting a dataset more than once. If someone else from any organization has cataloged the identical data on data.gov, do not enter it again.{% endhint %}

## Requirements to send something to data.gov

1. Set the appropriate [data.gov Metadata Repository tag](https://cookmt.gitbooks.io/mdeditor-for-lccs/content/product-entry-guidance/metadata-tab-product.html#metadata-repositories). 

2. List the LCC Network Data Steward first in the list of [Responsible Parties](https://cookmt.gitbooks.io/mdeditor-for-lccs/content/product-entry-guidance/main-tab-product.html#citation) (#0). data.gov only displays the first contact and the data steward should be listed first. 

3. Include a [Distribution Link](https://cookmt.gitbooks.io/mdeditor-for-lccs/content/distribution.html) where the product can be accessed or downloaded.
