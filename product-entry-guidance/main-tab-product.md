### POINT OF CONTACT\(S\)

Adding a point of contact gives LCC staff information on who to contact should they have a question regarding your project or product. From the **Role **drop-down menu, select **pointOfContact**. From the **Contacts **drop-down menu, select a contact from the list of contacts. _To add contacts to a metadata record, you must first create/upload the contacts into mdEditor. See the _[_Contact _](/product-entry-guidance/contact-entry-guidance.md)_Section for more information._

* **REQUIRED: **Enter **the LCC Network Data Steward **as a "pointOfContact."

> The LCC Network Data Steward will serve as the long term contact/backup. This way, users have a point-of-contact even if there is a positional change within an organization. The LCC Network Data Steward should be included in addition to any point of contact that you want to add from your organization

* **REQUIRED:** Enter your LCC as "pointOfContact."

* **BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE**: Enter the Project PI as "principalInvestigator."

### CITATION

**The Citation **lets LCC staff know pertinent information about your project or product such as: responsible parties; internal and ScienceBase identifier; and any online resources that may relate to your item. Adding information in the citation will also allow LCC staff to find your item when they search for items that contain said information.

#### ![](/assets/citation_updated.png)

The following fields are required in citation:

* **Title **\(Auto-Generated\)**: **Added automatically based on the title of your record.
* **Alternate Title \(**Optional\): Add an alternate title.

  * **REQUIRED: **Enter your LCC as "Administrator."

  > **NOTE: **If you know your items ScienceBase ID, you may add it here. If your item does not have a ScienceBase ID, ScienceBase will create one automatically upon publishing. If you edit an item that is already on ScienceBase without using its existing ID, a duplicate item will be created. Consult the [Publish](/publish.md) section of this manual to learn more.
  >
  > **Note: **If the product metadata was created by copying some other mdEditor metadata record, this identifier needs to be edited/changed since it will reflect the copied record identifier. Only the mdEditor UUID changes to represent a new record when an item is copied. Consult the [Copy Records](/data-management/copy-records.md) section of this manual to learn how to make a copy.

  * The following identifiers are optional but you may add them: 
    * _Digital Object Identifier \(DOI\)_
    * _Funding identifier_
    * _Archive Folder Name._
