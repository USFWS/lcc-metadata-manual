# Product Entry Guidance: Lineage Tab \(Optional for Products\)

**Lineage **is used to track the process of building spatial datasets. It's a space that can be used to describe the steps and sources used to create the product, and document the roles and contacts for the product contributors.

| Not required for LCC product metadata, but recommended. Lineage tab designed for documenting the creation of spatial data metadata |
| Can document who did the process, including role and contact. |
| If you have citation for a manual, you can simply create a citation instead of having to enter the information into the metadata |
| Use the Sources field to indicate what you used to create the product and then write a statement \(can do instead of writing all other steps\). |
