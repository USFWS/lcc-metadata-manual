## Product Entry Guidance: Associated Tab

---

The **Associated** section is used to connect metadata records with each other. This feature should be used when items are related, for example, products are often the result of projects, and projects often have sub-projects. Projects and Products can be linked together by using association. Adding associations will give LCC staff the ability to find items that relate to each other in ScienceBase.

> **NOTE:**  In ScienceBase **Associated Records **are referred to as **Item Associations. **

## Create Associations

There are two ways to create associations. You can either associate a product with a project **or **associate a project with a product. If you import records from ScienceBase, the record associations might be automatically created, but sometimes you may have to create the associations manually \(as described below\). Associations can only be made after both project and product records have been created in mdEditor.

| Use the _Select a Record_ button to select an associated project. |
| Choose the project that you would like to associate to from the "Select a Resource" list. |
