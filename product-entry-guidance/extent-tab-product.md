Spatial extents should be included for all applicable products. As a default, products can inherit extents from their parent project. geoJSON files for all LCC geographies are available on [ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5bd7c96fe4b0b3fc5ce82d44) (private DMWG folder that requires ScienceBase login). Download the relevant files and then import into mdEditor. 


{% hint style='tip' %} Tip: You can export, save, and import an extent to use for other projects or products.{% endhint %}
