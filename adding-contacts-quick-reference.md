| General Requirements |
| :--- |
| All LCC records _require at least one contact to serve as a point of contact for projects and products_. One contact must be LCC Network Data Steward. The LCC data steward will serve as the long term contact/backup if LCC staff are not available. The LCC Network Data Steward's contact information is as follows: **Individual Name:** _LCC Network Data Steward_ **Position Name**: _LCC Network Data Manager _**Contact Type**: lcc** E-mail Addresses**: l_ccdatasteward@fws.gov_ |
| You must create an organization contact for your LCC and any organization that is involved in your project or product \(partner, co-funder, etc.\) if there is not one already. |
| **Best Practices** |
| Always spell out acronyms when creating contacts |
