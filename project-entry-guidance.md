# Project Entry Guidance

---

### Before You Begin

* **Adjust your mdEditor settings: **
  * 

* **Select the LCC Project Profile**:
  * After initial creation of your project, and before you begin adding metadata, select **lccProject **from the **Profile** drop down in the main menu. This will limit the number of available tabs and only show tabs that contain fields that are required for project creation.

* **Make sure your contacts are loaded into mdEditor:**
  * In mdEditor, contacts are created separately from individual records, and then stored within a library in mdEditor. Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in metadata records.
