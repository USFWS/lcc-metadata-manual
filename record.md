### Navigation When Editing Records

* When editing a Metadata record, navigation **breadcrumbs** appear in light blue on top of the form. These can be used to navigate while editing a record.

* The **sub-menu navigation bar** is located below the breadcrumbs.  These change depending on what function is in use.

  * If you hover over the items, there will be a short description of what each section is.
