---

The Product Entry Guidance section will cover how to create a metadata record for an LCC product.

---

### Before You Begin

##### **Adjust your mdEditor**[** Settings**](/settings.md)**: **

* **Metadata Repositories**: In the Default Section of Settings, click "Add Metadata Repository." Select "LCCScienceCatalog" from the Repository drop-down menu. If you wish to also add your items to data.gov, once again click "Add Metadata Repository" and select "data.gov" from the repository drop-down menu.
* **Parent Identifier: **In the publishing settings, enter your LCC's ScienceBase project folder's identifier in the "Default Parent Identifier" field.

##### **Select the LCC Product Profile**:

* After initial creation of your product, and before you begin adding metadata, select **lccProduct **from the **Profile** drop down in the main menu. This will limit the number of available tabs and only show tabs that contain fields that are required for product creation.

##### **Make sure your contacts are loaded into mdEditor:**

* In mdEditor, contacts are created separately from individual records, and then stored within a library in mdEditor. Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in metadata records.
