# Contact Entry Guidance: Creating Individual Contacts

---

## Create a New Contact

* Click the plus \(![](/assets/symbol_plus_16.png)\) sign by **Contacts**.
* Specify if the contact is an **Individual** or an **Organization.**
* The **Contact ID **will be auto-generated by mdEditor.

_The following fields are available for** Individual Contacts:**_

* **Individual name \(**Required\): Enter individual's full name
* **Position name** \(Required\): Enter individual's full title, avoid acronyms
* **Contact Type **\(Required\): Enter the contact type from the picklist
* **Member Organization **\(Required\): Select organization\(s\); you can make an individual part of multiple organizations.
* **Email Address **\(Required\): Enter individual's email
* **Physical Address **\(Best Management Practice\): Enter a physical address
* **Logo **\(Optional\): 
  * You can either select or drop an image. If you choose to load an image, mdEditor will create a URI and will have a size limit for the logo. If you have a larger image, link to it rather than loading it into mdEditor. 
  * If an organization has a logo associated with it, individuals will inherit the logos from the organization. 

> Warning: If you upload a logo to your contact record, you must include a filename for the logo. Otherwise you will get an error on the metadata records that include that contact.

_All other fields are optional but recommended._
