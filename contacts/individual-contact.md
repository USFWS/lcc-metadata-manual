# Contact Entry Guidance: Creating Individual Contacts

---

## Create a New Contact

1. Click the plus \(![](/assets/symbol_plus_16.png)\) sign by **Contacts**.
2. Specify the contact is an **Individual**.
3. The **Contact ID **will be auto-generated by mdEditor.

_The following fields are available for** Individual Contacts:**_

* **Individual name **\(Required\): Enter individual's full name

* **Position name** \(Required\): Enter individual's full title; avoid acronyms

* **Contact Type **\(Required\): Enter the contact type from the picklist

* **Member Organization **\(Required\): Select organization\(s\). You can make an individual part of multiple organizations.

* **Email Address **\(Required\): Enter individual's email

* **Physical Address **\(Best Practice\): Enter a physical address

* **Logo **\(Optional\): 
  * It is uncommon that you would add a logo for an individual. If the individual is part of an organization, the individual will inherit the logo from the organization.
  * You can either select or drop an image. If you choose to load an image, mdEditor will create a URI and will have a size limit for the logo. If you have a larger image, link to it rather than loading it into mdEditor. 

{% hint style='danger' %} If you upload a logo to your contact record, you must include a filename for the logo. Otherwise you will get an error on the metadata records that include that contact.{% endhint %}

_All other fields are optional but recommended._
