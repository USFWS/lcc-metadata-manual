# Summary of Contact Requirements & Best Practices

---

The following compiles all of the required and recommended contact information for LCC project and product metadata. This information is also listed in the specific metadata sections in the manual.

## Locations for Contact Information

Once your contacts have been created in mdEditor, there are five places in a metadata record where you should add contacts.

_Please see the corresponding sections for which contacts should be added where. _

1. [Main Tab](/record/main/record-main-copy.md) / "Point of Contact” section 
2. [Main Tab](/record/main/record-main-copy.md) / Citation / “Responsible Parties” section 
3. [Metadata Tab](/record/main/metadata-tab.md) / “Contacts” section 
4. [Funding Tab](/record/main/funding-tab.md) / “Allocation”  section. For Projects only.
5. [Distribution Tab](/distribution.md) / "Contacts” section. For Products only.

### **Main / Point of Contact**

* Enter your LCC as a “pointOfContact” \(required\).

* Enter the LCC Network Data Steward as a “pointOfContact” \(required\).

* Enter the project PI as “principalInvestigator” \(best practice\).

### **Main / Citation / Responsible Parties**

* Enter your LCC as “administrator” \(required\).

* Enter the project PI as “principalInvestigator” \(best practice\).

* Can also add funders \(including your LCC\), partners, collaborators, contributors \(best practice\).

### **Metadata / Contacts**

* At least one contact with the role of “author” is required. Does not necessarily have to be the LCC \(e.g., imported FGDC metadata can list the original author\).

  * Can be an individual or an organization.

  * You can enter your LCC data manager as the “author”. You do not need to use individual names and can create a generic data manager for your LCC, but this is up to the individual LCC.

* Enter the LCC Network Data Steward as a “pointOfContact” \(required\).

* Enter a “publisher.” In most cases, it will be the LCC \(best management practice\).

### **Funding / Allocation \(for Projects only\)**

* Add the relevant contact for “source” of the project funding \(required\).

  * Should be an organization, not an individual. For LCC projects, the most common sources are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation.

* Add the relevant contact for “recipient” of the project funding \(required\).

  * Should be an organization, not an individual.

### **Distribution \(for Products only\)**

* Add the relevant contact for “distributor” of the product \(if you fill out anything in the Distribution section, a contact for Distributor is required\).
