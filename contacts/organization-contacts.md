# Contact Entry Guidance: Creating Organization Contacts

---

## Create a New Contact

* Click the plus \(![](/assets/symbol_plus_16.png)\) sign by **Contacts**.
* Specify if the contact is an **Individual** or an **Organization.**
* The **Contact ID **will be auto-generated by mdEditor.

_The following fields are available for **Organization Contacts:**_

* **Organization Name \(**Required\): The organization's full name, avoid acronyms
* **Email Address **\(Required\)**:** Add an email address of the primary contact in the organization. 
* **Online Resource** \(Required\): Add a web URL where your organization resides. Online resource may also include social networks.
* **Physical Address **\(Best Management Practice\): Enter a physical address
* **Logo** \(Optional\):

  * You can either select or drop an image. If you choose to load an image, mdEditor will create a URI and will have a size limit for the logo. If you have a larger image, link to it rather than loading it into mdEditor.

  * If an organization has a logo associated with it, individuals will inherit the logos from the organization.

  * If your contact contains a logo, you must include a filename for the logo or else you will get an error on metadata records that include that contact.

_All other fields are optional but recommended._
