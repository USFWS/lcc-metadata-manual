# Relationships Between Contacts, Projects, Products, and Funding

---

Contacts, projects, and products all share a relationship in mdEditor.

**Contacts** are the creators, curators, contributors, and funders of projects and products. Contacts can be individuals, organizations, or individuals who are members of organizations.

> Consult the [Contacts](/contacts.md) section of this manual for information on adding contacts.

**Projects and Products **will always have a relationship with a contact. Projects will always have at least one point of contact \(The LCC Network Data Steward\). Additional contact relationships may include project authors, metadata creators, funders, project PIs, publishers, distributors, and many others. One crucial contact relationship between contacts, projects, and products is the role of the individual\(s\) and/or organization\(s\) who contributed funding. This may include a direct full contributor or any partners that helped with funding.

**Products are often the results of projects**. mdEditor allows for the notation of the relationship between projects and products by using the Associated feature.

> Consult either the [Associating Records: Product](/product-entry-guidance/associating-records-products.md) or [Associating Records: Project](/record/main/associating-records.md) section of this manual for more information\).
