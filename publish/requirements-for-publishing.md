# Requirements for Publishing

Publishing requires the record to be a **valid record**, meaning that mdEditor checks that all required fields for a mdJSON file are present before allowing a record to be published. 



Publishing requires that you have a** Parent Identifier** assigned to every record. A parent identifier \(or Parent ID\) notes a folder on a database where the records will be stored upon publishing**.** The **Default Parent Identifier** can be set in mdEditor Settings. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual for more information.
