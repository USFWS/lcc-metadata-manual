# Requirements for Publishing

---

Publishing requires the record to be a **valid record**, meaning that mdEditor checks that all required fields for a mdJSON file are present before allowing a record to be published.

> **NOTE**: mdEditor does not check for LCC requirements. It only looks for metadata that fills ISO requirements. Fulfilling LCC requirements falls on the creator of the records. Consult the [**Project Entry Guidance**](/project-entry-guidance.md) and [**Product Entry Guidance**](/product-entry-guidance.md) sections for LCC requirements.

Publishing requires that you have a** Parent Identifier** assigned to every record. The parent identifier \(or Parent ID\) denotes the ScienceBase folder where the records are sent upon publishing. The **Default Parent Identifier** can be set in mdEditor Settings. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual for more information.

> **NOTE: **Please use a testing folder before you update your real records. \(Consult the** **[**Instructions for Testing Publishing**](/publish/instructions-for-testing-publishing.md)** **section of this manual for more information.\)
