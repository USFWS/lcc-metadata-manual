# Requirements for Publishing

---

Publishing requires the record to be a **valid record**, meaning that mdEditor checks that all required fields for a mdJSON file are present before allowing a record to be published.

> ![](/assets/note_small.png) mdEditor does not check for LCC requirements. It only looks for metadata that fills ISO requirements. Fulfilling LCC requirements falls on the creator of the records. Consult the [**Project Entry Guidance**](/project-entry-guidance.md) and [**Product Entry Guidance**](/product-entry-guidance.md) sections of this manual to learn what LCC fields are required.

Publishing requires that you have a** Parent Identifier** assigned to every record. A parent identifier \(or Parent ID\) notes a folder on a database where the records will be stored upon publishing**.** The **Default Parent Identifier** can be set in mdEditor Settings. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual for more information.
