# Troubleshooting Issues

Before you publish anything, click F12 \(Cmd + Opt + J on Mac\) to bring up the error console. Click on the three vertical dots for options on how to dock it.

The **Network tab** will show errors in Publishing when working with ScienceBase.

Click on the name of the row with errors and it will bring up a window - look at the **Preview Tab** to see the string of the error message.

Look for anything that appears red. If you see an error that is 400 and red, it’s a problem that you can address. However, If it’s a 500 level error in red, that is a Science Base error that is outside the scope of the mdEditor.
