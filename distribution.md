## Distributor
This section involves adding distributor information and a URL for data products that are hosted anywhere. For example, if The Nature Conservancy is hosting a data source, the distributor is "The Nature Conservancy."

### Contacts and Role \(Required\) 
If anything is filled out in the distribution section, a "distributor" contact must be added.

Select a contact from your contact list and select "distributor" for the role.

### Transfer Options (Required)

Transfer Options provide details regarding obtaining the product. Online and offline options are available.

#### Online Option (Required if Available) 
The most important thing to enter is the URL where the product can be accessed or downloaded. In the Function field, you can indicate the type of URL. If it’s a direct download, select “download.” If it goes to an informational page, select “information.”
