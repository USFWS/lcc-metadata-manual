> ![](/assets/note_small.png)An error may be hidden by profile type, so you may need to look at the full profile to find errors.  This is more likely to occur when converting and importing different metadata standards.

When all errors are resolved, the pencil edit icon on the left for that particular metadata record will turn green.
