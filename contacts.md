# Contacts

---

Contacts are individuals or organizations that can be referenced by other contacts, projects, or products. Contacts contain information such as name of individuals or organization, email address, physical address, website, and phone number so that viewers of metadata can communicate with those affiliated with a metadata record.

> ![](/assets/lcc_required_small.png)All LCC records require at least one contact to serve as a point of contact for projects and products. One contact must be  LCC Network Data Steward. The LCC data steward will serve as the long term contact/backup if LCC staff are not available. The LCC Network Data Steward's contact information is as follows.

> * Individual Name: **LCC Network Data Steward**
> * Position Name: **LCC Network Data Manager**
> * Contact Type: **lcc**
> * E-mail Addresses: **lccdatasteward@fws.gov**
>
> Consult the [**Individual Contact**](/contact/individual-contact.md) section of this manual to learn how to add this information and create the Network Data Steward.

Consult the [**Organization Contacts**](/contact/organization-contacts.md) section of this manual to learn what fields are required.

### General notes on Contacts

Copying contacts will change the ID and the name \(the name will be “Copy of ….”\) but all the other information will be the same.

> **Best practice**: It is safest to export all contacts whenever you export a project/product. This insures that the most current contact information is available in the mdEditor. \(Consult the [Export](/export.md) section of this manual to learn more.\)
>
> **Best Practice: **Leave your contacts in mdEditor so that they’re always available.
>
> **Best Practice: **Always spell out acronyms when creating contacts
