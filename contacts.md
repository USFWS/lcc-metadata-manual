# Contacts

---

Contacts are individuals or organizations that can be referenced by other contacts, projects, or products. Contacts contain information such as name of individuals or organization, email address, physical address, website, and phone number so that viewers of metadata can communicate with those affiliated with a metadata record. They also allow LCC staff to know who is responsible for, or participated in: the creation and maintenance of projects and products; funding of projects; and creation and maintenance of metadata.

### General Notes on Contacts

![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)![](/assets/note_small.png)

###### Best Practices & General Notes

| Best Practice: **Creating/Editing Contacts ** | Notes: **Creating/Editing Contacts** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Always spell out acronyms and organization names. | When you edit a contact, the information will also update the metadata records that include that contact, and the edited contact will update to ScienceBase when you publish the records. |
|  | Copying contacts will change the ID and the name \(the name will be “Copy of ….”\) but all the other information will be the same. |

| Best Practice: Maintaining Contacts in mdEditor | Notes: Maintaining Contacts in mdEditor |
| :--- | :--- |
| Leave your contacts in mdEditor so that they’re always available. | Leaving contacts in mdEditor makes them available for addition in any new or existing projects or products. |

| Best Practice: Exporting Contacts | Note: Exporting Contacts |
| :--- | :--- |
| It is safest to export all contacts whenever you export a project/product. | When you import a contact, if the contacts list isn't complete, the record may show an error and you will be unable to re-add the contact to the record. |
