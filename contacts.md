# Contacts

Contacts are individuals or organizations that can be referenced by other contacts, projects, or products. Contacts contain information such as name of individuals or organization, email address, physical address, website, and phone number so that viewers of metadata can communicate with those affiliated with a metadata record.

###### Best Practices & General Notes

| Best Practice: **Creating/Editing Contacts ** | Notes: **Creating/Editing Contacts** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Always spell out acronyms and organization names.  | When you edit a contact, the information will also update the metadata records that include that contact, and the edited contact will update to ScienceBase when you publish the records. |
|  | Copying contacts will change the ID and the name \(the name will be “Copy of ….”\) but all the other information will be the same. |
