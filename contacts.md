# Contact Entry Guidance

---

Contacts are individuals or organizations that can be referenced by other contacts, projects, or products. Contacts contain information such as the names of individuals or organization, email address, physical address, website, and phone number so that viewers of metadata can communicate with those affiliated with a metadata record. They also allow LCC staff to know who is responsible for, or participated in: the creation and maintenance of projects and products; funding of projects; and creation and maintenance of metadata.

### General Notes on Contacts

In mdEditor, contacts are created separately from individual records, and then stored within a library in mdEditor. Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in metadata records. Editing a contact in the mdEditor contact library will update the contact information included in any metadata record that uses that contact. Editing a contact in mdEditor will also update contact information on Science Base once the record is published.

It is recommended that you leave contacts in mdEditor in-between work sessions. This allows you to readily add contacts to projects and products.

It is also recommended that when you export records, you also export your entire contact list when you export records. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not in your library, you may receive an error and have to re-enter the contact to that record.

**Once your contacts have been added to mdEditor, there are three places in a metadata record where contacts can/must be added. **

_Please see the corresponding sections for which contacts should be added where. _

1. The "Point of Contact” Section of the [Main Tab](/record/main/record-main-copy.md)
2. The “Responsible Parties” Section in the Citation of the [Main Tab](/record/main/record-main-copy.md)
3. The “Contacts” Section of the [Metadata Tab](/record/main/metadata-tab.md)

### Best Practices for Contacts

![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)![](/assets/note_small.png)

* Always spell out acronyms and organization names.
* Copying contacts will change the ID and the name \(the name will be “Copy of ….”\) but all the other information will be the same.
* Make sure your contacts are loaded and accurate in mdEditor before beginning to create your metadata records.
