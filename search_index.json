Metadata Manual\n\nNote: This is a working draft that will continue to be edited. Last updated: 4 December 2018. Please refresh this manual every time you open it to ensure you are viewing the most recent version.\nIntroduction\nThis manual describes the requirements and best practices for the creation of high-quality and consistent metadata records for projects and products from the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). These metadata requirements conform to the standardized metadata format agreed upon by the LCC Data Management Working Group. This metadata drives the unified LCC Science Catalog, where LCC projects and products are discoverable, accessible, and usable.\nLCC Metadata and mdEditor\nA metadata editing tool was created to support the metadata requirements for LCCs: mdEditor. This was an extension of an initiative by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group (ADIwg) and adopted by the LCCs.\nThis manual refers to the creation of LCC metadata specifically. If you want information on the creation of other metadata records using mdEditor, or more information in general, please refer to the mdEditor User Manual.\n\nWho Should Use this Manual\nThis guide is for anyone creating or updating metadata for LCC-related projects and products. The primary purpose is for items that go into the LCC Science Catalog but this can also be followed for any project or funding you want to track in ScienceBase.\nThe metadata requirements described here apply to science projects and products that were funded by the LCCs (for more details, see the LCC Project, Products, and Contacts section). \n\nHow to Use this Manual\nDirectly accessing this manual from the internet is the recommended way to use this manual. By doing so, you will guarantee you are always using the current version since it is a live document and any updates can be made instantly. The online version will also have the best functionality and graphical display.\nIf needed, you can download this manual as a PDF and save a copy to your computer for printing or offline use. If you choose this method, be sure to reference the online version regularly and save a new PDF as updates are made to the online version. Also note that not all of the formatting will be exactly the same as the online version.\nSome of the stylized text boxes (like this one) will not translate to the PDF exactly. The text will still be outlined with a background color, but the icon to the left of the text will not display in the PDF.\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThis manual was developed while mdEditor was also being developed. Due to this, there may be minor discrepancies between screenshots in the manual and the current production version of mdEditor.\n"},"lcc-science-catalog.html":{"url":"lcc-science-catalog.html","title":"LCC Science Catalog","keywords":"","body":"LCC Science Catalog\n\nA more detailed look at the parts and pieces behind the LCC Science Catalog.\n\nOverview\nThe LCC Science Catalog collates the metadata from all 22 LCCs and Headquarters. It allows for user-defined searching and filtering of projects and products as well as access to products for download. Users can see what has been funded, which can help prevent duplication of work. The LCC Science Catalog also enables reporting, such as funding summaries or project examples based on particular geographies, species, organization, year, or other categories of interest.\nArchitecture [editing in progress]\nLCCs edit metadata in mdEditor and then publish the metadata to ScienceBase, where it can be channeled to the LCC Science Catalog and data.gov. The mdTranslator tool is integrated with mdEditor so you can create metadata once, and then convert and publish the metadata in your desired format, such as mdJSON for the LCC Science Catalog, sbJSON for ScienceBase, XML for data.gov, and FGDC for geospatial data.\nThe following diagram details the LCC Science Catalog system architecture.\n  \n\nItems are imported from a database (like ScienceBase), or created directly in mdEditor.  \n\nmdJSON files can also be stored in a local repository and then transmitted via a web service to ScienceBase. Alternately, the local files can be exported to a web accessible folder and then harvested by ScienceBase.  \n\nThe mdTranslator converts the mdJSON files into sbJSON (the ScienceBase JSON format), and XML.  \n\nItems are exported from ScienceBase to: Data.gov as XML; the LCC Science Catalog website as Projects and Products; or into mdEditor as mdJSON.\n\n\n"},"background.html":{"url":"background.html","title":"Background","keywords":"","body":"Background (editing in progress)\n\n\nWe envision a well-functioning data management, integration, and sharing process that integrates, at minimum, the products of Network-funded projects with those from individual LCC-funded projects, and that supports the data lifecycle in a coordinated manner.—LCC Network Conservation Science Plan v.1\n\n\nThe 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) developed uniquely and independently based on the needs of their regions and partnerships. As a result, there was not a single workflow for data management and sharing among the LCCs. Instead there were multiple workflows, varying formats, and different use cases for managing and sharing the results of LCC-funded projects. Further, because LCCs placed varying levels of importance on data management, LCCs varied greatly in their staff capacity for data management.\nWhile the individual workflows met the needs of the individual LCCs and their partner organizations, they were not enough to achieve the goal of a network-wide, integrated dynamic project and product database. Through collective agreement, LCCs agreed they needed to modify their workflows to create comparable project and product metadata. \nProcedurally, the LCC Network has committed to using ScienceBase for cataloging all funded projects and associated products. As per the LCC Network’s response to a DOI Office of the Inspector General 2017 report, individual LCCs must contribute their project and product metadata to the ScienceBase repository by the end of 2017 and mid-2018 respectively. In tandem with this ScienceBase requirement, the LCC Network is required to post data products to data.gov and this data conduit will be in place with products cataloged by end of 2018.\nThis guidance was developed by the LCC Data Management Working Group (DMWG) with the leadership of the Architecture Subgroup (ASG).\n\nLCC Science Catalog Goals and Objectives\nGoal 1: Provide an easily searchable repository for LCC- and LCC Network-funded science projects and products through the LCC Science Catalog.\nObjective 1.1: Enable efficient and consistent searching and filtering across all LCC projects and products.\nObjective 1.2: Ensure resource managers and partners can continue to find and use LCC information and products for decision-making and conservation action on the landscape.\nObjective 1.3: Support users (e.g., resource managers, scientists, auditors, graduate students) in identifying remaining/future science needs and preventing future duplication of work by displaying who and what LCCs have funded.\nObjective 1.4: Ensure the LCC Science Catalog will remain accessible through a portable design that can be hosted on fws.gov, if needed.\nGoal 2: Increase transparency of LCC project funding information.\nObjective 2.1: Document how FWS and other sources of funding were used to fund science projects\nObjective 2.2: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how FWS and other sources of funding were allocated to partners (e.g., states, tribes, federal agencies).\nObjective 2.3: Allow data managers to use the Science Catalog as an internal project tracking system.\nGoal 3: Demonstrate the impact and value of the investment in landscape-scale conservation.\nObjective 3.1: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how investments by FWS and other federal programs leveraged additional funding by partners.\nObjective 3.2: Demonstrate the depth and breadth of the projects and products produced by LCCs and the partners and collaborators involved.\nGoal 4: Illustrate the link between LCC-funded applied science projects and today’s conservation challenges.\nObjective 4.1: Link LCC projects and products to overarching Conservation Issues.\n"},"lcc-projects-products-contacts.html":{"url":"lcc-projects-products-contacts.html","title":"LCC Projects, Products, Contacts","keywords":"","body":"LCC Projects, Products, and Contacts\n\nUnderstanding Projects, Products, and Contacts\nContacts, projects, and products all share a relationship in mdEditor and are each entered independently.\nProjects\nA project encompasses a discrete effort on a particular topic with defined goals or objectives. The target projects for the LCC Science Catalog are science projects whose topics and resulting products have value to partners or the public being able to discover and access them. Many projects are the result of LCC issued financial assistance agreements, contracts, or inter-agency agreements. However, not everything funded through one of these mechanisms needs to be in the Science Catalog. For example, a contract to maintain an LCC's individual website likely does not quality as a \"science project\" nor provide public-relevant information. A grant to develop an interactive landscape-conservation tool, however, would be a science project that results in public-relevant information.\nLCC projects can also include other defined efforts that did not necessarily require the awarding of funds.\n Individual data managers may want to track other projects using the same metadata format and store that information on ScienceBase, without publishing it to the LCC Science Catalog. \n\nProducts\nA product is a resource, usually (but not necessarily) developed as an output from a project. Products can be tools, data, maps, reports, etc. These will usually be the direct result of a project though there may be some products without a parent project.\nNot every output of a project is necessarily a product, however. For example, meeting minutes do not have standalone value as a publicly-available resource. It is up to each LCC to determine which outputs should be entered as products.\nContacts\nContacts are the individuals and organizations involved with projects and products (e.g., collaborators, funders). Contacts are entered once in mdEditor and can be added to multiple projects and products.\nConsult the Contacts section for information on adding contacts.\n\nRelationships\nProjects and Products will always have a relationship with contacts. Projects will always have at least one point of contact (LCC Network Data Steward). Additional contact relationships may include project authors, metadata creators, funders, principal investigators, publishers, distributors, and many others. One crucial contact relationship between contacts, projects, and products is the role of the individual(s) and/or organization(s) who provided funding. This may include a direct full contributor or any partners that helped with funding.\nContact types are specified in the contact record (examples: federal, state, NGO). Specific roles for each contact are defined within the respective project and product records (examples: principal investigator, collaborator).\n\nProducts are often the results of projects. mdEditor defines the relationships between projects and products through the Associated feature.\n Consult either the Associating Records: Product or Associating Records: Project section for more information).\n\n"},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Workflow","keywords":"","body":"Workflow\n\nSuggested Workflow for LCC Metadata and mdEditor\nThe following is a suggested workflow for using mdEditor to create, publish, and save metadata records for LCC projects and products.\nStep 1: Gather information needed for your metadata entries.\nHave information about your contacts, projects, and products on hand before you begin creating metadata records. Key information to gather includes project proposals, funding agreements and amounts, project reports, product information, and contact information for individuals and organizations involved in the projects.\nUse the \"contacts seed file\" that contains pre-filled information and standard naming conventions for all LCCs, common federal agencies, and the LCC Network Data Steward.\nStep 2: Open mdEditor.\nThe direct link to mdEditor is https://go.mdeditor.org. Choose the browser you plan to use for mdEditor and bookmark this link.\nmdEditor can also be accessed from its homepage at https://www.mdeditor.org/. This site provides some background information and Frequently Asked Questions about mdEditor.\nAlways hit refresh in your browser before each work session (and periodically throughout the session) to ensure that you are using the most updated version of mdEditor.\nStep 3: Set the correct default Settings.\nIn mdEditor settings, set the LCC-specific settings for Importing from ScienceBase, Metadata Repositories, and Publishing.\nStep 4: Create or import Contacts.\nContacts must be created or uploaded before they can be added to project and product metadata records.\nStep 5: Create or import Projects.\nIf you have an existing ScienceBase project record that has not been edited in mdEditor, import the ScienceBase record to create a new mdEditor record. Workflow guidance.\nIf you have no existing metadata for a project, create an mdEditor project record from scratch. Workflow guidance.\nIf you have already created an mdEditor record for the project, import the mdEditor file to continue editing. Import guidance.\nStep 6: Create or import Products.\nIf you have an existing ScienceBase product record that has not been edited in mdEditor, import the ScienceBase record to create a new mdEditor record.\nIf you have no existing metadata for a product, create an mdEditor product record from scratch.\nIf you have already created an mdEditor record for the product, import the mdEditor file to continue editing.\nStep 7: For applicable Products, create or import Data Dictionaries.\nStep 8: Complete metadata.\nDecide on your desired file management approach and complete your metadata accordingly. See the File Management section for options and instructions.\nStep 9: Create desired Associations between Projects and/or Products.\nAssociations can be either associated from a project or associated from a product.\nStep 10: Publish your records to ScienceBase.\nStep 11: Export your records and contacts for backup, transfer, or sharing.\nYou may want to export working backups before publishing depending on your situation, but archival exports should be done after publishing since publishing can alter records, like adding or changing a ScienceBase ID.\nStep 12: Review the resulting entries in the LCC Science Catalog.\nThe Science Catalog updates overnight so you should review newly-published records the day after you publish to ScienceBase.

This site provides some background information and Frequently Asked Questions about mdEditor.\nStep 3: Import mdEditor file(s).\nImport the mdEditor file(s) that you wish to edit. Remember, once you have edited and published metadata from mdEditor, you must always use mdEditor to update the metadata (rather than make changes directly on ScienceBase). The Science Catalog will only update based on what is in mdJSON (and not sbJSON).\nStep 4: Check the Settings.\nEnsure the correct LCC-specific settings are in place for Importing, Metadata Repositories, and Publishing.\nStep 5: Update Contacts.\nIf you have new contacts to add to your metadata record, create those contacts.\nStep 6: Update Projects.\nUpdate/edit metadata as needed.\nStep 7: Update Products.\nUpdate/edit metadata as needed.\nStep 8: For applicable Products, create, import, or update Data Dictionaries.\nStep 9: Check Associations between Projects and/or Products.\nIf you only updated metadata in existing record that were already associated, you do not need to do anything with the associations.\nIf you created a new product for your project, then associate those records in mdEditor.\nStep 10: Publish your records to ScienceBase.\nCheck that your record published where expected and that the mdJSON and xml files are attached to the SB Item. Your records should publish to their existing locations. If you added a new product to a project, then it should appear as a new child item to the project.\nStep 11: Export your records and contacts for backup, transfer, or sharing.\nYou may want to export working backups before publishing depending on your situation, but archival exports should be done after publishing since publishing can alter records, like adding or changing a ScienceBase ID.\nStep 12: Review the resulting entries in the LCC Science Catalog.\nThe Science Catalog updates overnight so you should review newly-published records the day after you publish to ScienceBase. This will be one of your best quality control checks.\nStep 13: Consult with the different QA/QC Resources.\nSee the QA/QC Resources page for the different tools available to check your metadata.\n"},"getting-started/pts.html":{"url":"getting-started/pts.html","title":"PTS Considerations","keywords":"","body":"Workflow: Project Tracking System (PTS) Considerations\n\nConsult this section for things you need to consider if you are using the Project Tracking System (PTS) for managing your project metadata.\n\n[content to be added]\n"},"settings.html":{"url":"settings.html","title":"Settings","keywords":"","body":"Settings ()\n\nThe settings menu allows for the configuring of user-specific options. Settings must be configured before you create LCC metadata.\n\nGeneral Settings\nmdEditor Version: The mdEditor version notes the current version of mdEditor. Use this when reporting errors. Errors can be reported at https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues. You must have a github account in order to post.\nAuto-Save: The Auto-Save option will write all changes to local storage when you exit a data entry field. Changes must be manually saved if the Auto-Save feature is turned off.\nAuto-Save allows you to save less frequently, but it makes it harder to undo changes that you make to your records. If you stay on the same record, you can cancel changes. But once you leave the record, the record is saved and you can’t cancel the change except by manually re-editing the record.\n\nClear All Records: All records can be cleared by clicking the \"Clear Storage Cache.\"\nWarning: Clearing all records will delete all of the records currently loaded in mdEditor. Before doing so, use the Export function to make a backup of your records. Otherwise, the records will be permanently lost (unless you previously made a backup copy).\n\n\n\nLCC Specific Settings\nThese must be implemented before you begin creating metadata records.\n (1) Importing from ScienceBase\nIn the Defaults section, set the default Import URL to import items from ScienceBase with the following: https://api.sciencebase.gov/sbmd-service/mdjson/.\n(2) Metadata Repositories: In the Defaults section, add two Metadata Repositories.\n\nSelect LCCScienceCatalog from the Repository drop-down menu. Enter “LCC Network Science Catalog” as the collection title.\nSelect data.gov from the Repository drop-down menu. For the collection title, enter \"data.gov\" followed by the LCC name without acronyms. For example \"data.gov Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative\".\n\n The metadata repository information must be exactly the same for each record with no variations in spelling, spaces, capitalization, etc. Specifying this information in Settings is the best way to ensure the repository information will be consistent across records. It is strongly recommended that you do not type these in by hand on individual metadata records. \n\n(3) Parent Identifier: Under publishing, enter the ScienceBase identifier for your LCC's ScienceBase project folder in the \"Default Parent Identifier\" field.\n\n\nDefaults\nDefaults include settings for Language, Character Set, Country, and the *Import URL *(used for defining the default URL for importing). \n\nThe following defaults will be pre-loaded:\n\ndefault language: English\ndefault character set: UTF-8\ndefault location: USA\n\nAlso included in Defaults are the Metadata Repositories (online databases for storing metadata). Once entered in Settings these can then be selected for projects and products so that they are flagged to a metadata repository of your choice. See LCC Specific Settings for Metadata Repository information.\n\nPublishing Settings\nLCC metadata will be published directly to ScienceBase (and from there be sent to the Science Catalog and data.gov). \nIn the Default Parent Identifier, enter your LCC's ScienceBase project folder's ScienceBase ID (SBID). Default Community and Default Organization are free text fields to describe where your Default Parent Identifier is located.\n\n\nExport Settings\nSee the Export section for information about the options available for Exporting.\n"},"data-management.html":{"url":"data-management.html","title":"File Management","keywords":"","body":"File Management\n\nFile management in mdEditor consists of consistent and proper handling and storage of mdEditor derived formats of metadata. These files are essential for long-term access to metadata beyond a single work session.\n\nHow mdEditor Stores Information\nmdEditor stores information on your local computer in your browser's localStorage cache (not the normal file cache). This means that if you use a different browser to access mdEditor, it will not show the metadata records from your original browser. It also means that clearing your browser's cache generally will not delete your mdEditor records. However, depending on your browser's settings, clearing your browser cache may still delete your mdEditor data (e.g., in Chrome, checking the \"cookies and other site data\" option will clear your mdEditor data).\nWarning: In mdEditor settings, you can clear your storage cache. Doing so will remove all of the information currently loaded in mdEditor. Reasons you might want to clear your storage cache is due to too much information stored in the cache, or as a way to debug a problem with mdEditor. It is very important that you back up your records before clearing the mdEditor cache to avoid losing your data. Consult the Export or Settings section of this manual to learn more.\n\n\nmdEditor File Format\nThe underlying format of the metadata from mdEditor is mdJSON, which was created specifically for mdEditor.  There are two types of mdJSON files.\n\nmdJSON files are the format that is published from mdEditor and made available on ScienceBase and data.gov. Their default file name is md_metadata.json.\n\nmdEditor.json files are the files used by mdEditor. They contain extra information, such as settings, that tell mdEditor how to operate. Their default file name is mdeditor-timestamp.json. \n\n\nmdJSON files can be exported and imported via mdEditor's built-in Export and Import functionality. The Export functionality allows you to back up and share your records between browsers. The Import functionality lets you load records into mdEditor, either from previously-saved mdEditor session, exported from another browser, or downloaded from ScienceBase.\nJSON = JavaScript Object Notation, an open source file format. mdEditor produces mdJSON. ScienceBase has their own specific format, called sbJSON.\n\n\nmdEditor File Management Strategies\n(1) Work on a project-by-project basis.\nTo keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on one project (and its related products and contacts) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that your LCC uses to organize data.\n\nSave each project and affiliated products together as a set. To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, then select the appropriate records (i.e., the target project and its affiliated products) and then click “Export Selected.\"\n\nSave the resulting mdEditor JSON file to your hard drive in a working folder. There should be a separate mdEditor JSON file for each project and all of its products.\n\n\n(2) Leave information in mdEditor between work sessions.\nIt is recommended that you leave your contacts in mdEditor between work sessions so that they will be available the next time you need to create metadata records. You can also export your contacts independently of your records for use between browsers.\nYou can also set up a metadata directory so you can always find the metadata file. This directory can be any folder on your local computer that is easily accessible and will not be deleted.\n(3) Export your contacts with your records.\nWhen exporting products or projects, you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not loaded in mdEditor, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact for that record.\n  If contacts records are re-created, it results in another mdEditor identifier being created for a contact, resulting in duplicate contacts. mdEditor does not know that this is an existing contact. You should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors. \n\n(4) Export frequently to backup your records.\nMaintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor (or switch browsers, URLs, etc.). This is the most efficient way to backup your records. For more information, consult Export.\nIt is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor's Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered in mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records. Consult the Settings section of this manual to learn more.\n\n"},"data-management/import.html":{"url":"data-management/import.html","title":"Import","keywords":"","body":"Import ()\n\nThe Import function loads an mdEditor or mdJSON file into the current mdEditor session. You can also import existing ScienceBase metadata or FGDC (Federal Geographic Data Committee) metadata into mdEditor to create mdJSON.\n\nGeneral Import Settings\nReplace vs. Merge\nThe Replace/Merge toggle allows you to either replace or merge the imported records with the records currently loaded in mdEditor. In most instances you should select \"Merge.\" An exception is when you want to import Settings associated with an mdEditor file (see below).\n Selecting \"Replace\" will remove all metadata records currently in mdEditor and leave only the newly-imported files. If you are importing a record to add to the existing records, choose \"Merge.\"\n\nImport Settings\nOnly mdEditor files store Settings information; mdJSON files do not. You must import Settings to retain metadata repository information, default ScienceBase parent identifier, and auto-save preference.  To import the Settings with an mdEditor file, set the import to \"Replace\" (be sure you have already saved a backup copy of any files currently in mdEditor). Set the mode back to \"Merge” once you’ve finished importing the Settings.\nIf you have records already loaded into mdEditor with all desired Settings, then you do not need to re-import Settings when you import additional mdEditor files.\n\nSee next sections for specific file format import guidance on mdJSON, sbJSON, and FGDC metadata.\n"},"data-management/import/mdjson.html":{"url":"data-management/import/mdjson.html","title":"mdJSON","keywords":"","body":"Import mdEditor or mdJSON Files\n\nYou can click or drag and drop a file onto the Import Data button to import a local file.\n\n\nReview the selected information.

Exports an mdEditor JSON file.\n\nExport Selected: will only export the items you have selected (so individual records, contacts, etc.). If nothing is selected it will be disabled (i.e., grayed out). This exports an mdEditor JSON file.\n\nExport mdJSON: only works for metadata records (i.e., doesn't work for contacts). Exports just the mdJSON file, which is a standalone JSON file you can load into mdTranslator and have translated into other metadata formats. mdJSON files imported into mdEditor are treated as new records and will not merge/update an existing record.\n\nClicking the Include Settings switch will also export mdEditor settings (only for mdEditor files). Consult the Settings section of this manual to learn about settings.\n\n\n If you need to switch browsers for mdEditor, or want to send your settings to someone else, you can export the settings. Someone else can then re-import your settings which include the default Metadata Repositories and Publishing Settings.

Look for useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. There are GCMD Platforms and Instruments Keywords but they are unlikely to apply to LCCs.\nBest Practice: Check the \"Full Path\" checkbox to save the full path of the keyword to your metadata. This will maintain the category and context of the specific keywords chosen.\n\n\nCustom Thesaurus\nIf any of your desired keywords do not appear in the existing thesauruses, you can add them via the custom thesaurus. Use a custom thesaurus only for keywords that are not available in an existing thesaurus. For example, if a certain end user type is not available in the LCC End User Types thesaurus, you can add the type using the custom thesaurus.\nYou cannot add keywords to an existing thesaurus; you can only add keywords in a custom thesaurus.\n You cannot save a custom thesaurus in mdEditor.\n\n Tip: If you have a consistent set of keywords that you use across your LCC's projects, you could add these to a \"template project\" record in mdEditor and then modify the specific keywords you need for each project. See the workflow section for more info about using template records.\n\n\nKeywords and ScienceBase\nKeywords vs. Tags\nmdEditor uses the term \"keywords\" while ScienceBase uses the term \"tags.\" \nKeywords edited in mdEditor will not overwrite keywords stored in sbJSON on ScienceBase because ScienceBase only adds to the list of tags. If you do not want obsolete keywords/tags to show up on ScienceBase, you will need to manually delete in ScienceBase. mdJSON and the LCC Science Catalog, however, will reflect any changes made in mdEditor.\n\nImported Keywords\nIf you imported your project metadata from ScienceBase, then the ScienceBase keywords are each created in a custom thesaurus.\nIf your LCC already has a controlled vocab list in ScienceBase, unfortunately it cannot connect to mdEditor. The selected keywords for any specific record will import into mdEditor but the saved list will not.\n\n\n"},"record/main/taxonomy-tab-projects.html":{"url":"record/main/taxonomy-tab-projects.html","title":"Taxonomy Tab: Project","keywords":"","body":"Project Entry Guidance: Taxonomy Tab\n\nTaxonomy is required for projects and strongly recommended for products (where applicable).\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Project Taxonomy Tab\nRequired?\n\n\n\n\nTaxonomy\nRequired if Applicable (*New Required Metadata Improvement)\n\n\n\n\nTaxonomy\nmdEditor's new “Taxonomy” section automatically pulls in taxonomic information from ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System – see itis.gov for more information). \nPlease note that this functionality in mdEditor is not intended to explore ITIS. It is a tool to add known taxonomic information to your metadata. If you want to explore ITIS, go to itis.gov to find information and then come back to mdEditor with the desired search values.\n\nThe minimum requirements for valid taxonomy are a Taxonomic System plus one or more taxonomic classifications.\nAdd Taxonomic System\n(1) Click \"Add Collection\" \n\n(2) From here, you can click \"Add Taxa from ITIS\" directly (on right side) without adding the taxonomic system. This will be filled in for you automatically once you have added items from ITIS.\n\n(3) Enter your search terms in the search box. You can type in a common name, scientific name, or TSN (Taxonomic Serial Number, assigned by ITIS). You can type in any level of taxonomy, not just species name (e.g., you can type in an order or class or genus). You can specify by Kingdom if you like.\nIf you haven’t used the search in a while (or ever) the ITIS service might be asleep so it will take a few more seconds to load but then will load quickly after that.\n\n The status of the taxonomic classification is denoted in () after the TSN. ITIS may consider a classification \"invalid\" if the species was reclassified, for example. It is up to you whether you want to add invalid ITIS classifications to your metadata. \n\n\n(4) Click \"Add\" for the search results you want to add to your record and then click \"Import Taxa.\" You will get a message of successful import at the bottom of your screen.\n You don't need to worry about clicking import multiple times for the same species. mdEditor is smart enough to know not to create duplicate entries of the same species.\n\n\n(5) Click \"Back to Collection.\" You will see that it has added a taxonomic hierarchy. It has also added a Title to Taxonomic System (if you hadn’t already added one by hand). This complete the the minimum information required for taxonomy.    \n You can click on any level of the taxonomic hierarchy to collapse the entries below that level.\n\n mdEditor only adds common names at the lowest taxonomic level you identified (e.g., species level). \n\n\n(6) You can add additional information regarding the taxonomic information if you desire.\nObservers would be filled out when there were people who actually went in the field/lab and identified species. Here you would lie the people who did that work.\n\nGeneral Scope: You can add a description of the range of taxa addressed in the dataset or collection.\n\nIdentification Procedure: You can describe the methods used for taxonomic identification.\n\nIdentification Completeness: You can add information regarding completeness and uncertainty in the identifications.\n\n\nVoucher is where you can add information about specimens you submitted to a museum or a storage facility where you are storing specimens, can document that here (select a Repository via a Contact entered in mdEditor).\n\n\nWhen Taxonomy is Needed\nTaxonomy is mostly used for search is discovery and functions similar to keywords. \n If you have existing species names or other keywords, you do not need to delete those. Taxonomy is entered in a separate section in mdJSON so they are separate from Keywords. \n\nTo some extent, this is up to the judgement of the data manager. You will know best the connection of a resource to a specific species or other taxonomic group. For example, if a bear model was used to rank habitat for a prioritization product but the final output is not relevant to bears any longer, then you probably wouldn't want to add bear species in taxonomy.\n\nReporting Issues\nIf you encounter issues or bugs using the new Taxonomy feature, please report them in this github thread: https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues/101 (requires github account to post).\n"},"record/main/extent-tab.html":{"url":"record/main/extent-tab.html","title":"Extent Tab: Project","keywords":"","body":"Project Entry Guidance: Extent Tab\n\nExtent refers to geographic boundaries for your project.

You can draw a polygon or a bounding box in the initial window.\nYou can export spatial extents and re-use for other records using the import feature button or by dragging and dropping onto the map. \nExtents are limited to 5000 vertices. Recommend you create only simple polygons or bounding boxes. If you want greater detail, attach high-definition shapefiles instead of trying to draw them.\nExtents should be accurate enough for searching purposes, but remember that they are metadata, not data.\nOption 1: Import Spatial Features\nSpatial features such as geoJSON, shapefiles, and kml can be imported. However, file attributes (such as name and description), will not be imported and must be added manually. \nFor projects without a specific extent, you can use the LCC geography. Projects should have custom extents when it is relevant to the scope of the project. Remember, these extents will be used for search and discovery purposes. geoJSON files for all LCC geographies are available on ScienceBase (private DMWG folder that requires ScienceBase login). Download the relevant files and then import into mdEditor. \n Important: coordinates used must be geographic coordinates, not projected coordinates.\n\nOption 2: Draw Spatial Features\n Tip: It is easier to click \"finish\" when drawing a polygon instead of trying to close the polygon by clicking on the first point.\n\nOption 3: Draw Bounding Box\n mdEditor can automatically calculate a bounding box if you have at least one extent in the metadata. \n\n\nBounding boxes will not work across the dateline but you can have more than one extent per project. If your project area crosses the dateline, split the area into multiple extents and create separate bounding boxes.\n\nSaving and Exporting Extents\n Tip: You can export, save, and import an extent to use for other projects or products.\n\n\n\n"},"record/main/documents-tab-projects.html":{"url":"record/main/documents-tab-projects.html","title":"Documents Tab: Project","keywords":"","body":"Project Entry Guidance: Documents Tab\n\nThe Documents tab is where you can add references to resources that relate to your project but do not define or describe the project.

Award IDs include grant or cooperative agreement numbers, contract numbers, or inter-agency agreement numbers. Inclusion of Award IDs provides accountability and allows tracking and auditing between financial systems and the Science Catalog.\nAmount (Required)\nEnter the amount of funding.\nSource (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “source” of the project funding. Source should be an organization, not an individual. For LCC projects, the most common sources are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation. LCCs should be added as the funding \"administrator\" in the Other Contacts field.\n Funding source should always identify the agency or organization, rather than a sub-program or office. For example, all funding from other FWS programs need to list U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the source (and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.). Clarifications on the exact program or office where the funding came from can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field (and choose the role of \"administrator\").\n\nRecipient (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “recipient” of the project funding.

Specifying the \"Linked Association Type\" will create the association from the other direction. \n Important: It is recommended you ALWAYS specify the Linked Association Type when you create associations. This will ensure the associations are defined from both directions and be present in the metadata no matter how the metadata is translated or where it is used in the future. \n\nIf you import records from ScienceBase, the record associations might be automatically created, but sometimes you may have to create the associations manually (as described below).

Look for useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. There are GCMD Platforms and Instruments Keywords but they are unlikely to apply to LCCs.\nBest Practice: Check the \"Full Path\" checkbox to save the full path of the keyword to your metadata. This will maintain the category and context of the specific keywords chosen.\n\n\nCustom Thesaurus\nIf any of your desired keywords do not appear in the existing thesauruses, you can add them via the custom thesaurus. Use a custom thesaurus only for keywords that are not available in an existing thesaurus. For example, if a certain end user type is not available in the LCC End User Types thesaurus, you can add the type using the custom thesaurus.\nYou cannot add keywords to an existing thesaurus; you can only add keywords in a custom thesaurus.\n You cannot save a custom thesaurus in mdEditor.\n\n Tip: If you have a consistent set of keywords that you use across your LCC's projects, you could add these to a \"template project\" record in mdEditor and then modify the specific keywords you need for each project. See the workflow section for more info about using template records.\n\nLook for useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. GCMD Science keywords would be the only ones applicable to LCCs. There are GCMD Platforms and Instruments but they are unlikely to apply to LCCs.\n\n\nKeywords and ScienceBase\nKeywords vs. Tags\nmdEditor uses the term \"keywords\" while ScienceBase uses the term \"tags.\"\nKeywords edited in mdEditor will not overwrite keywords stored in sbJSON on ScienceBase because ScienceBase only adds to the list of tags.

Contacts contain information such as the names of individuals or organizations, email address, physical address, website, and phone number so that viewers of metadata can communicate with those affiliated with a metadata record. Contacts also enable users to know who is involved in the creation and maintenance of projects and products, funding of projects, and creation and maintenance of metadata.\n\nGeneral Info on Contacts\nIn mdEditor, contacts are created separately from individual records and then stored within a library in mdEditor. Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in any metadata record. Editing a contact in the mdEditor contact library will update the contact information included in any metadata record that uses that contact. Editing a contact in mdEditor will also update contact information on ScienceBase once the record is published.\n You should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors. \n\nCopying contacts will change the ID and the name (the name will be “Copy of ….”) but all the other information will be the same\nIt is recommended that you leave contacts in mdEditor in between work sessions. This allows you to readily add contacts to projects and products.\n It is recommended that when you export records, you also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not in your library, you may receive an error and have to re-enter the contact to that record.\n\n\nBest Practices for Contacts\n\nAlways spell out acronyms and organization names.\nMake sure your contacts are loaded and accurate in mdEditor before creating or editing your metadata records. \n\n\nContacts Seed File\nThe \"contacts seed file\" contains pre-filled information and standard naming conventions for all LCCs, common federal agencies, and the LCC Network Data Steward. Using this file will increase consistency across all LCC metadata records for common contacts and reduce the amount of processing needed before records go into the Science Catalog.\n\nImporting Contacts from ScienceBase\nWhen you import a ScienceBase record, mdTranslator will automatically load all sbJSON contacts into Main/Citation/Responsible Parties. You MUST review this to check for errors and inconsistencies introduced during translation. Delete any duplicate or extraneous contacts or any errors. Then continue with edits to meet requirements, follow best practices, and add other contacts as desired.\n\n \n"},"contacts/individual-contact.html":{"url":"contacts/individual-contact.html","title":"Individual Contacts","keywords":"","body":"Contact Entry Guidance: Creating Individual Contacts\n\nCreate a New Contact\n\nClick the plus () sign by Contacts.\nSpecify the contact is an Individual.\nThe Contact ID will be auto-generated by mdEditor.\n\nThe following fields are available for Individual Contacts:\n\nIndividual Name (Required): Enter individual's full name\nIf you are entering a generic Individual contact, you can enter a Position Name without entering an Individual Name.

LCCs should be added as the funding \"administrator\" in the Other Contacts field.\n Funding source should always identify the agency or organization, rather than a sub-program or office. For example, all funding from other FWS programs need to list U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the source (and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.). Clarifications on the exact program or office where the funding came from can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field (and choose the role of \"administrator\").\n\nRecipient (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “recipient” of the project funding. Recipient should always be an organization, not an individual. For example, the Principal Investigator would not be listed as the recipient, but their organization would be. If there are multiple recipients for a project, they need to be added as separate allocations.\nYou could add the Principal Investigator in the Other Contacts field as \"principalInvestigator.\"\nOther Contacts (*New Required Metadata Improvement)\nAdd the LCC as the funding \"administrator\" for all LCC allocations.

However, if you need to publish your record to a location different than your default folder, then you need to add a Parent ID to your metadata record (see Metadata/Parent Metadata).\n Note: Please use a testing folder before you update your real records.

Consult the Instructions for Testing Publishing section for more information.\n\n\nDetermine your workflow for testing:\nIf you DO NOT already have items on ScienceBase. Choose a project and its products to test.\n BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: It's recommended that you export a project and its products into its own mdEditor file. Set default parent identifier as a ScienceBase folder.\nIf you DO already have items on ScienceBase, choose one of the following approaches. Note that it will be harder to test without it affecting your real records.\n Approach 1 - Take a simple project and product set, and make a copy of the mdEditor records. In the test version, delete all ScienceBase IDs (SBIDs) and parent IDs. The SBID will either be located in the citation, or if you imported the record from SB, the SBID will be the record identifier. Set default parent identifier as a folder.\n Approach 2- Publish directly to a real record if you are okay with the risk it presents.\n\nSet your Default Parent Identifier in Settings.\n\nSelect one project with its associated products to test.\n\nFollow the publishing instructions above for the scenario that applies to you.\n\nLook for any errors in the third column. If you see an error that is 400 and red, it’s a problem that you can address. However, if it’s a 500 level error in red, that is a ScienceBase error that is outside the scope of the mdEditor.\n NOTE: Any unsolvable issues can be submitted on the issues page for mdEditor: https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues. You must have a github account in order to post.\nAdvanced users can check errors using the console. Consult the Advanced Users section of this manual to learn more.\n\nVerify that your test records have published as expected in your folder on ScienceBase (or to the real record if that’s how you are testing).\n\nAfter you are satisfied with how your test records published to ScienceBase, you can proceed with publishing your real record.\n\nUpdate your mdEditor settings to your real Default Parent Identifier.\n\nUsing the record you just tested, proceed with publishing to the real location on ScienceBase.\n\nMake sure any test SBIDs are removed entirely from the record you want to actually publish.\n\nVerify that the real records have updated as expected.\n\nProceed with publishing your other records to their real locations.\n\n\n"},"publish/how-to-publish.html":{"url":"publish/how-to-publish.html","title":"How to Publish","keywords":"","body":"How to Publish\n\nBEST PRACTICE: Always refresh your browser before you access the publishing menu to ensure that you are using the most updated version of mdEditor. However, if you have already moved items around in the publishing outline (see below for details), you will lose this information once you refresh.\n\nPublishing Overview\nStep 1: Login to ScienceBase\nStep 2: Move Records in the Publishing Outline\nStep 3: Submit for Publishing\nStep 4: Review Records on ScienceBase\nStep 5: Review Entries in the LCC Science Catalog\n\nStep 1: Login to ScienceBase\n\nClick the Publish button from the top menu in mdEditor.\n\nYou will be asked to select a publishing service. Click on ScienceBase.\n\nA login window will appear on the right side of the screen - enter your ScienceBase ID and password, and click Login. When you are logged in, the login window will display who you are logged in as. The current user must have read/write permissions on ScienceBase for any items to be published (including parent items). You cannot publish until you are logged in.\n\n\n\nThe mdEditor Publishing Outline:\nYou will see a list of every valid record in mdEditor in the publishing outline with its ScienceBase Identifier (if the record already exists on ScienceBase) and its parent ScienceBase Identifier (if present in the metadata). This publishing outline shows records in a parent-child relationship and reflects what you would see when you publish to ScienceBase.\n Remember: Parent-Child relationships refer to how the records are organized and displayed on ScienceBase. This is different than the Project and Product associations identified within the metadata records. \n\n\nRecords without parent IDs already in their metadata will appear directly under the ScienceBase header in the publishing outline. These records will be published under the default parent identifier you established in the settings. The Default parent identifier is listed in the ScienceBase header, which is hyperlinked to the record on ScienceBase. \n\nRecords with parent IDs identified in their metadata will appear below a thick blue line and will be published under the parent ID listed in their metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\nItems directly below the ScienceBase header will be published under the ScienceBase item identified in your settings as “Default Parent Identifier.” Items below the blue line will be published under the parent ID specified in the metadata.\nFor example, if the Default Parent Identifier is your LCC Community, then projects at the root level in the publishing outline will be added directly under your LCC Community, but products nested under a project in the outline will be added as a direct child item to the project item on ScienceBase. Items listed at the root level in the publishing outline don't have a parentID that correspond with a record loaded in mdEditor (Note: you could have other parent IDs identified in those records, but those records aren't loaded in mdEditor)\nNotes on Moving Records\nYou can drag and drop records to establish the parent-child relationship, eliminating the need to establish the relationship in ScienceBase. This will also allow you to move items around (e.g., move a product from one project to another) and have that change be reflected on ScienceBase. Remember, this is only about parent-child relationships on ScienceBase, not about project-product associations.\n If you do not want these parent IDs to change, do not drag and drop these records in the publishing outline.\n\nGeneral Notes on Parent IDs:\n\nIf you move a product under a different project, it will update that product’s parent ID.\nParent IDs established through the relationships in the publishing outline will overwrite existing parent IDs in the metadata.\nDragging and dropping a record onto the ScienceBase header at the top will set that record’s parent ID to the default parent ID you identified in Settings.\nIf you have existing parent IDs in your metadata (and want to keep them as is), do not drag and drop those records onto the ScienceBase header-- this will erase the existing parent ID and insert what you have set as the default parent identifier.\n\n\nStep 2: Move Records in the Publishing Outline\nBefore you move records in the publishing outline please select your scenario below and follow the corresponding guidance.\nScenario A\nYou do not have items on ScienceBase yet, and your desired parent-child relationship is to have each product as a direct child of a project item on ScienceBase:\n\nYour records will all display under the ScienceBase header in the publishing outline. \nThese items will be published as a direct child item under the SB item identified in your settings under “Default Parent Identifier.”\n\n\nYou can drag and drop records in the publishing outline to establish parent-child relationships for ScienceBase.\nYou can nest items in as many levels as you desire (the most common is a product nested under a project).\nTo move a record back to the root level, drag and drop it on the top line that says “ScienceBase Default”.\n\nScenario B\nYou have existing parent-child relationships on ScienceBase and/or you have intermediate folder(s) between project items and products (i.e., products are not direct child items of Project Items - this is not recommended).\n\nIf you have parent-child relationships already established on ScienceBase (and those IDs are reflected in the mdEditor records), you likely do not want to move the records around in the publishing outline.\nIf your products are housed in a “Products” folder on ScienceBase (or other intermediate folders between the project item and the products), then your products will not be nested under projects in the publishing outline. \nThe parent ID for those products is the “Products” folder (which would not have a record in mdEditor). If this is your situation, do not change the structure in the publishing outline and publish as is (i.e., with every item organized at the root level in the outline).\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Submit for Publishing\n\nTo select a record to publish, click on it and it will turn green (click again to un-select it).\n You cannot publish a record without a parent ID. Sending a non-existent parent ID to ScienceBase will return an error. If your records contain parent IDs in the metadata, you can choose to publish products without publishing their associated projects at the same time.\n\n\nmdEditor will publish your records sequentially, starting with the top record (it will publish the project first, then the products nested below it).\n\nIf you are publishing to your default parent identifier or if you have changed any project-product relationships in the publishing outline, you will see the updated parent IDs appear in the outline as publishing occurs. If you’re publishing to the existing locations on ScienceBase, the IDs won’t change.\n\nThese new/updated IDs will be injected directly into the mdJSON file in mdEditor. However, these updated IDs will not be included in the mdJSON file that is attached to ScienceBase as part of the publishing process. You would have to publish the record a second time to update the mdJSON file attached on ScienceBase.\n\n\n\nUpon successfully publishing to ScienceBase, the third column will display a date and time. The record's ScienceBase ID will be displayed in the first column, and the Parent ID will be displayed in the second column. If there are any errors during publishing, they will be noted in the third column.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Review Records on ScienceBase\n\nOnce publishing is done, refresh ScienceBase to ensure everything is showing up how you expected it would show up.\n\nSB items should have an mdJSON and XML file attached\n\nSB items should be in the location reflected in the mdEditor publishing outline\n\n\n\nYou can re-publish records as needed (e.g., after updating or correcting metadata).\n\n\n\nStep 5: Review Entries in the LCC Science Catalog\nThe Science Catalog updates overnight so you should review newly-published records the day after you publish to ScienceBase. This will be one of your best quality control checks.\n"},"publish/re-publishing.html":{"url":"publish/re-publishing.html","title":"Re-Publishing","keywords":"","body":"Re-Publishing\n\nOnce you have published your records for the first time, updating and re-publishing them is straightforward.\nHow to Re-Publish\n\nLoad the desired mdEditor files into mdEditor.\n\nMake necessary updates and changes to the metadata.\n\nGo to the Publish tab and login to ScienceBase.\n\nSelect the records you want to re-publish and hit Publish.\n\nVerify that the mdJSON file published to the ScienceBase page.\n\n\n The mdJSON published to ScienceBase will always contain all of the updated information you published. sbJSON (and thus what is displayed on the ScienceBase page) will not always do so. Specifically, keywords that you delete in mdEditor will not be deleted from sbJSON.

This page is temporary and will be removed from the LCC Metadata Manual after the Metadata Improvements round has concluded.\n\nTimeline for Metadata Improvements\n\nOctober 17 (Wednesday): Metadata improvements round begins.\n\nConcurrently HQ will be working with DJ Case to complete the Science Catalog development and update needed functionality and search filters.\n\n\n\n\nBetween October 17 and 24: New Taxonomy functionality available in mdEditor.\n\nDecember 7 (Friday): Deadline to complete metadata improvements (by start of SA National Program Meeting). The Science Catalog will also be updated by this date. This provides approximately 8 weeks for improvements, QA/QC, etc.\n\n\n\nDefinitions\nMetadata Categories:\n\nQA/QC Fixes: These are common and recurring errors in the metadata that need to be fixed and are based upon the original metadata requirements.\n\nNew Required Improvements: These are new requirements for metadata that have been previously undefined (or were previously optional rather than required).\n\nOptional Improvements: These are optional improvements that will improve the metadata but are not required.\n\n\nPriority Level:\n\nMust Do: These improvements are required and essential for ensuring consistency across metadata records and functionality of the Science Catalog.\n\nLower Priority: These improvements are lower priority compared to the rest of the list, but are still recommended to address if possible.\n\n\n\nImportant Note Before You Begin\nIf you have any items where the mdJSON did not publish to ScienceBase, those items are not currently in the Science Catalog and the automated QA/QC checks from DJ Case will NOT be able to identify issues with those records. It is strongly recommended that you check the ScienceBase scanner for any SB records that are missing mdJSON and re-publish those records before proceeding through metadata improvements. Remember that newly-published mdJSON will not be reflected in the Science Catalog until the following day (it updates daily overnight).\n\nMust Do: mdEditor Files\nAll mdEditor files (NOT just the mdJSON files) need to be in a central location accessible to the Architecture Subgroup as well as the respective Region's personnel. These are needed to ensure future updates, corrections, or improvements can be made to any metadata. The ASG proposes that everyone post their mdEditor files to the ScienceBase folder that was set up for mdJSON during the Seattle workshop.\nLink (you must be logged in to ScienceBase to access): https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59bb08efe4b091459a563da2 \n"},"metadata-improvements/qaqc-fixes.html":{"url":"metadata-improvements/qaqc-fixes.html","title":"QA/QC Fixes","keywords":"","body":"Metadata Improvements: QA/QC Fixes\n\nMust Do QA/QC Fixes\nMain\n(1) Products need to have a specific resource type selected (not “product”) AND they need to be valid resource types. See QA/QC list from DJ Case.\nMain/Citation\n(2) Responsible Parties need to have a valid role selected. See QA/QC list from DJ Case.\nMetadata Repositories\n(3a) Ensure you have a single version of your data.gov tag and it is consistent across all of your items. See ScienceBase scanner.\n(3b) If you update your Metadata Repositories in mdJSON and publish to ScienceBase, you will also need to delete the erroneous version from ScienceBase (called Harvest Sets in SB). The issue is that SB doesn’t remove tags when an item is republished, it just adds to tags. This issue applies to all keywords, but it is most important to fix for Harvest Sets. This scenario can happen with both erroneous data.gov tags or misspelled Harvest Set tagging.\nYou may want to consider using the injector script to delete or replace erroneous versions from mdJSON. You would still be required required to manually remove the erroneous versions from SB items.\nFunding\n(4) LCC allocations need to list the funding agency as the source (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), not the LCC. See QA/QC list from DJ Case.\n\nAdditionally, all funding from other FWS programs need to list FWS as the source (and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.). Clarifications on the exact program or refuge where the funding came from can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field (and choose the role of \"administrator\").\n\n(5) All allocations should list the fiscal year when the funds were allocated (this is different than a project's overall start and end dates - those are entered in Main/Time Period). There should be only a single fiscal year identified per allocation. Use the “Pick a Fiscal Year” dropdown to autofill the date fields.\n\n(6) All allocation recipients should be an Organization, not an Individual contact. Clarifications, although not required, can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field (e.g., list a \"principalInvestigator\").\nContacts\n(7) All contacts need the appropriate contactType identified—this is particularly important for funding summaries. See QA/QC list from DJ Case.\n(8) Address the Contact QA/QC list from DJ Case.\n\nNote: this is a static list that was generated during the initial creation of the Science Catalog. The spreadsheet will not update when you fix an issue listed. Please update the \"Fixed\" column to \"yes\" when you have addressed a particular item.\n\nKeywords\n(9) Fix “consevation design” Typo. Select correct option in mdEditor and re-publish. Affected records can be viewed here (this is a link to a saved Science Catalog search for the erroneous keyword).\nDistribution\n(10) Distribution links need to be included for products. This was already required for all products and this is particularly critical for items sent to data.gov. This is the only online resource data.gov reads so without a URL here, there is no way for a user to access the actual product. The recommended role is \"distributor\" (see the Product Distribution section for more info).\nNote: Matt Heller is looking into a solution (mid-November) using the injector script so data managers could run this automated process themselves to meet minimum requirements.\nFixing Errors\n(11) Republish any records that don’t have mdJSON attached (without mdJSON, the item will not show up in the Science Catalog). See ScienceBase scanner.\n(12) Go through errors/warnings in the ScienceBase scanner (e.g., no ISO Keyword, bad repo tag, etc.) .\n(13) Address remaining QA/QC issues from DJ Case.\n(14) Fix the errors identified by the ASG in manual QA/QC checks of the Science Catalog.

You can see the time of the last scan for each community on the top page and on each community page.  \nIf you have made changes in ScienceBase since then, you can requery ScienceBase using the \"rescan\" link at the end of the status line on the individual community pages (choose Summary on the top page, then read the top lines of the display).\nMissing Keywords You Know Are Entered\nThere may be instances where you have added keywords for ISO Topic Category, LCC Project Category, LCC Deliverable Type, or LCC End User Type but the ScienceBase scanner is showing them as missing. This may have been an issue introduced for LCCs who used the template scripting (i.e., input metadata into a spreadsheet that Josh scripted into mdEditor to create your initial metadata records). Below is a possible way to check and solve that issue.\n(1) If you go into the Keywords section of your record, you may see that there are entries under \"Selected Keywords\" but those selections aren't highlighted green in the tree of options.\n(2) Click on the desired options in the tree, which will add a duplicate set of those keywords in \"Selected Keywords.\"\n\n(3) Delete the duplicate keywords from the top of the list.\n\n(4) Now your keywords should be selected properly.

Data.gov only shows the first contact and the data steward should be listed first.\nFunding\n(3) Add funding “administrators” for all LCC allocations in Funding/Other Contacts (as opposed to assuming the administrator is the LCC if FWS is listed as the funding source).\nThe previous guidance on how to list LCC funding was based upon the existence of only a single contact field for funding allocation source. The addition of the “Other Contacts” field to meet the needs for multi-LCC and CASC co-funded projects provides new functionality to better clarify funding sources and administrators. Having to interpret the situation where FWS is listed as the funding source to mean it was LCC funding is not a logical and best practice to move forward on. The lack of the LCC name in the funding source will muddle our ability to accurately understand funding moving forward beyond LCCs. As we move into SA-centric data management and even broader use of mdEditor, it will be even more vital to have clear indications of who provided funding. The funding administrator field can differentiate from multiple sources within a single agency (e.g., within FWS can differentiate programs like SA, MB, Refuges, etc.).\nNote: You may be able to use the injector script to fix this issue. Matt Heller will provide guidance.\nExtents\n(4) Spatial extents should be included for all projects and applicable products. Products can inherit extents from their parent project. For projects without an extent already, you can use the LCC geography. We will provide geoJSON files for all LCC geographies that you can import into mdEditor.\nThis enables consistent search and discovery via the Science Catalog and allows users to search for resources using a map select tool. It will also allow any future functionalities based on geography to be automatically applied to your items without any further changes needed (for example, if identifying congressional districts is identified as a need in the future, these could be automatically assigned to records based on the spatial extent). \nKeywords\n(5) LCC End User Type is required for projects AND products. An oversight in the first version of metadata requirements only had this required for projects but it should also be entered for all products.\nTaxonomy\n(6) Add Taxonomy via new functionality in mdEditor. This is required for Projects and optional for Products (but strongly recommended) if you have specific species or taxonomic groups as part of your metadata record.  \nThis will enable consistent taxonomic searching in the Science Catalog and will ensure the LCC records will be compatible with future metadata records that will be generated from mdEditor for non-LCC projects.\n\nLower Priority Metadata Improvements\nFunding\n(7) Complete in-kind and matching fund information for all projects. Ideally this should be completed for all projects but the priority is to complete and fix all agency funding information first.\nContacts\n(8) Every Individual contact who belongs to an organization should have their organization identified in “Member of Organization.”\nKeywords\n(9) Choose GCMD Keywords for all projects and products.

It also means that if you clear your browser's cache, it will generally not clear your mdEditor records.

See\nhttps://toolchain.gitbook.com/ for detailed instructions. The short version\nfollows.\nThe following is required:\n\nNodeJS (v4.0.0 and above is recommended)\ngit\nA Markdown editor/IDE (ATOM is a good open source choice)\nWindows, Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X\n\n\n\nInstall gitbook-cli using npm:\n $ npm install gitbook-cli -g\n\n\nClone the mdEditor GitBook:\n $ git clone https://git.gitbook.com/cookmt/mdeditor-for-lccs.git\n\n\nSetup GitBook\n $ cd mdEditor-for-lccs\n $ gitbook install\n\n\nStart the local GitBook server\n $ gitbook serve\n\n\nOpen a browser to: http://localhost:4000\n\nStyle Guide\n\nThis section covers styling conventions required for this documentations. Some of\nthe conventions rely on plug-ins that enhance the native GitBook Markdown functionality.\nIn some instances, the effects of the plugins are not displayed until after the\nbook has been generated.\nHeadings\nPlease use headings to define page sections. Heading levels should appear\nsequentially without gaps (don't skip heading levels). Headings should start at\nLevel 1 for the page title. Headings should not be used purely to define font\nstyles - if absolutely necessary, use CSS for that. Following this convention\nwill make it possible to parse the markdown  programmatically, e.g. to\ndynamically create a table of contents.\nLists\nOrdered lists\nOrdered lists are processed irrespective of the actual number assigned to each list item.\nFor Example:\n1. first\n2. second\n3. third\n\nfirst\nsecond\nthird\n\n\nis rendered the same as:\n1. first\n12. twelfth\n30. thirtieth\n\nfirst\ntwelfth\nthirtieth\n\n\nTherefore, one recommended convention is to use 1. for every item in an ordered\nlist. This makes it easier to insert or remove items from the list, at the\nexpense of slightly less readable Markdown. If you choose to sequentially order\nthe list items, you must make sure the numbers are sequential to avoid confusion.\nList headings\nHeadings may be use in lists. However, special handling is required to ensure\nbullets for ordered lists are styled appropriately.\nThe tasks tag is available for styling \"task lists\". For simplicity, all of the various heading levels are styled the same.\nExample without task tag\n\n1. ## Level 2\n1. ### Level 3\n1. ###### Level 6\n\nExample without task tag\n\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 6\n\n\n\nExample with task tag\n\n\n1. ## Level 2\n1. ### Level 3\n1. ###### Level 6\n\nExample with task tag\n\n\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 6\n\n\n\n\nIcons\nFontAwesome icons are available. Use an\n tag to render the chosen icon.\n  Happy Birthday \n  Happy Birthday \n\nButtons\nBootstrap 3 style buttons are supported. Use a  tag since these are\nfor documentation only. Icons may be combined with buttons.\nDefault\nPrimary\n Success\nInfo Extra - Small\nWarning - Small\nDanger - Large\nLink\n\nDefault\n\n\nPrimary\n\n\n Success\n\n\nInfo Extra - Small\n\n\nWarning - Small\n\n\nDanger - Large\n\n\nLink\n\nHints\nStyled hint blocks are supported.\n{% hint style='info' %}\nImportant info: this note needs to be highlighted\n{% endhint %}\n\nThere are five supported variations.\n\ninfo (default)\ntip\ndanger\nworking\nplain\n\nInfo: this note needs to be highlighted.\n\nTip: 20% is customary.\n\nDanger: this is going to blow up!\n\nWorking: for the man every night and day...\n\nPlain: booooooorrrrring.\n\nScreenshots\nThe following software is required:\n\nLibre Office Draw\nA tool to capture screenshots\nWindows, Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X\n\n\nTypes of screenshots\n\nbasic screenshots have no annotation or markup applied\nannotated screenshots have markup applied, e.g. callouts, highlights, etc.\n\nRequirements for all screenshots\n\nMinimum 1200px wide\nMust include a caption\nPNG format\nGenerally browser window captures should only contain minimum user interface\ncontrols, without navigation toolbar, tab bar, bookmarks toolbar, or status\nbar.

Exceptions to this requirement are made\nfor images used in multiple sections.\n\nImage sizes should be as small as possible without sacrificing quality.\nUsually significant size reduction can be achieved by color-type or bit-depth\nreduction. pngcrush is a good tool for this.\n\nRequirements for annotated screenshots\n\nUse LibreOffice Draw to create the annotations\nA template is available here /assets/documentation-guide/callouts-template.odg\nEach screenshot should be placed on a new page\nWhenever possible place annotations in callouts outside of the image or\nin a way that  does not cover user interface elements\nName the page using the name of the PNG file\nExport the screenshot to PNG\nonly export the\ncompression level 6\n1200 pixels wide\n\n\n\n\nAll annotated screenshots for a section should be stored in a single .odg file.\nSave the LibreOffice Draw file (.odg) in the directory with the screenshots\nImage 2: Creating screenshots using LibreOffice Draw\n\n\nScreenshot captions\nTo apply a caption to a screenshot use this syntax in the Markdown.\n![caption goes here](/assets/path/to/image){caption}\n\nImage 3: Screenshot with caption\nTo apply a border to a screenshot, add class=border.\n![caption goes here](/assets/path/to/image){caption class=border}\n\nImage 4: Screenshot with border\nApplying the {caption} to a image will also indent the image from the surrounding text.\nBookmarlet for Screenshots\nUse this bookmarlet: Plain Window.
