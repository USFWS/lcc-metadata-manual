# Publish

Users can publish records to an online platform. The current option is ScienceBase, a collaborative data cataloging and data management platform developed by the United States Geological Survey. It provides a centralized, searchable, and publicly-available repository for data. You must have a ScienceBase user account with publishing rights in order to publish to ScienceBase.
