# LCC Metadata Manual

---

_Note: This is a working draft that will continue to be edited. Last updated: 12 September 2018_

## Introduction

This manual describes the requirements and best practices for the creation of high-quality and consistent metadata records for projects and products from the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives \(LCCs\). These metadata requirements conform to the standardized metadata format agreed upon by the LCC Data Management Working Group. This metadata drives the unified [LCC Science Catalog](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/cookmt/mdeditor-for-lccs/edit#), where LCC projects and products are discoverable, accessible, and usable.

### LCC Metadata and mdEditor

A metadata editing tool was created to support the metadata requirements for LCCs: mdEditor. This was an extension of an initiative by the [Alaska Data Integration Working Group](http://www.adiwg.org/about/) \([ADIwg](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#adiwg)\) and adopted by the LCCs.

_This manual refers to the creation of LCC metadata specifically_. If you want information on the creation of other metadata records using mdEditor, or more information in general, please refer to the [mdEditor User Manual](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/).

## Who Should Use this Manual

This guide is for anyone creating or updating metadata for LCC-related projects and products. The primary purpose is for items that go into the LCC Science Catalog but this can also be followed for any project or funding you want to track in ScienceBase.

The metadata requirements described here apply to science projects and products that were funded by the LCCs \(for more details, see the [LCC Project, Products, and Contacts](/lcc-projects-products-contacts.md) section\).

## How to Use this Manual

Directly accessing this manual from the internet is the recommended way to use this manual. By doing so, you will guarantee you are always using the current version since it is a live document and any updates can be made instantly. The online version will also have the best functionality and graphical display.

If needed, you can download this manual as a PDF and save a copy to your computer for printing or offline use. If you choose this method, be sure to reference the online version regularly and save a new PDF as updates are made to the online version. Also note that not all of the formatting will be exactly the same as the online version.

{% hint style='info' %}
Some of the stylized text boxes \(like this one\) will not translate to the PDF exactly. The text will still be outlined with a background color, but the icon to the left of the text will not display in the PDF.
