# User Manual: mdEditor for LCCs

---

## **Overview**


**Making information discoverable, accessible, and usable**
This manual describes how staff from the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) can create high-quality, consistent metadata to support the LCC Science Catalog, which will make LCC projects and products discoverable, accessible, and usable. 

A unified LCC Science Catalog requires a standardized metadata format across the LCCs. With this ultimate goal in mind, this manual describes the requirements, recommendations, and best
practices for the creation of LCC data records (Contacts, Projects, and Products) for upload onto the ScienceBase catalog. This guidance was developed by the LCC Data Management Working Group with the leadership of the Architecture Subgroup.

 _This manual refers to the creation of LCC metadata specifically_. If you want information on the creation of other metadata records using MDEditor, or more information in general, please refer to the [MDEditor User Manual](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/).


## Requirements for using mdEditor

* Google Chrome Web Browser
* Meta Information about your project, as needed.
