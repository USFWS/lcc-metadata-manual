## How mdEditor Stores Information

---

mdEditor stores information on your local computer in your browser's[ localStorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage) cache. Storing information on the browser's localStorage cache \(instead of a normal file cache\) means that if you use a different browser to access the mdEditor, it will not show the data you've imported from your first browser. It also means that if you clear your browser's cache, it will generally not clear your mdEditor records. However, depending upon your browser settings \(E.g., in Chrome, if the "c_ookies and other site data_" option is checked\), clearing your browser cache may still clear your mdEditor data.

Someone might want to clear their storage cache due to too much information stored in the cache, or as a way to debug some problem with the mdEditor.  **It is very important that you back up your records before clearing the mdEditor cache in order to prevent a loss of data. **Consult the [Export](/export.md) or Settings section of this manual to learn more.
